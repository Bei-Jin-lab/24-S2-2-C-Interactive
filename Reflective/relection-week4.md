### Weekly Reflection

**Landing Page**
This week, our team made significant progress on the landing page. We discussed its functionality and design, ensuring that users are directed straight to the content. A critical decision was made regarding the structure and presentation of the landing page, although we would have appreciated more clarity on who initially raised the idea, the specific domain it addresses, and any changes made throughout the process. Tracking these decisions more meticulously could help us in reflecting on our design choices and understanding the evolution of our project better.

**Statement of Work (SOW)**
The feedback on our SOW was eye-opening. It was pointed out that the document lacked essential details, especially in defining our core functionalities. For example, when comparing our chatbot to Google's search engine, we need to clearly articulate our unique value proposition. Why should users prefer our chatbot over established tools like Google? This reflection has made me realize the importance of not just drafting technical documents but ensuring they are comprehensive and convey the full scope of our project's potential.

**Risk Log**
The creation of a separate risk log was emphasized, with clear guidelines on how to manage potential issues. This includes documenting possible risks, their consequences, and contingency plans. A key learning point for me was understanding the breadth of risks that need to be considered—everything from team members falling ill to technical failures like database backup issues or lack of backend expertise. This exercise underscored the necessity of proactive risk management in our project planning.

**Documentation Tools**
A discussion arose about whether to use GitHub for documentation. Andy suggested using more traditional documentation tools instead. This raised an important question about choosing the right tools for our project needs. While GitHub is excellent for version control and collaborative coding, it may not be ideal for documentation that requires more formal and structured presentation. This discussion has prompted me to reconsider how we approach documentation to ensure clarity and accessibility for all stakeholders.

**Shadow Meeting**
The concept of shadow meetings was particularly interesting. These meetings, akin to client meetings, are designed to help teams identify and troubleshoot issues, understand project requirements, and showcase their progress. The mutual review process was beneficial in ensuring that we remain aligned with our project goals and deliverables. Although we haven't had meeting with our shadow team, we believe that this experience will reinforce the importance of clear communication and collaborative problem-solving in project management.

**Database Access Issue**
Lastly, an issue with using ANU’s database login was raised, but it was reassuring to hear that perfection isn’t the expectation—making the best possible decisions with the resources available is what counts. This perspective is a valuable takeaway, reminding us that while striving for excellence is important, adaptability and sound judgment are equally critical in navigating project challenges.

**Summary**

In summary, this week was marked by significant learning and reflection on various aspects of our project. From decision-making processes to risk management and documentation practices, each discussion contributed to a deeper understanding of how to navigate the complexities of our project more effectively. Moving forward, I aim to apply these lessons to improve both my individual contributions and our team’s overall workflow.
