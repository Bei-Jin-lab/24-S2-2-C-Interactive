### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- First, while handling the features, I analyzed each feature to identify the necessary entities and their attributes within the system.  This process made me realize the importance of data structure in system design and how these attributes influence the overall functionality of the system.
- The UML diagram, this visual tool not only helped me better comprehend the system structure but also facilitated quicker understanding and alignment among team members.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- Clear attribute design is crucial for the subsequent development, preventing ambiguity in functionality.
- Drawing the UML diagram helped me organize my thoughts more effectively and proved to be an excellent communication aid within the team. 
- Based on the feedback from the presentation, I realized that our initial development approach needed to change due to insufficient research into alternative tools. While we initially considered using other platforms, it became clear after the feedback that my understanding of these tools wasn’t solid enough to move forward with confidence. As a result, we plan to shift towards using SharePoint as the primary platform, as it aligns better with our project safety needs. Moving forward, I will ensure to conduct more thorough research to prevent similar challenges and make more informed decisions.
