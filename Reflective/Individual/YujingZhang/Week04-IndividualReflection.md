**Name**: Yujing Zhang

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

This week, my main tasks included attending the client meeting, recording the team meeting, collecting data, and drafting the data collection documentation.

From the client meeting, I gained a clearer understanding of the project timeline and deliverables. The client emphasized the need to demonstrate the chatbot implementation by Week 7 and prepare for an internal presentation in Week 8. This helped me see the importance of aligning our progress with their expectations.

Recording the team meeting allowed me to track discussions and decisions, ensuring that all members stayed updated on their responsibilities. Additionally, collecting data required careful planning to define the data scope, collection process, and documentation format. Writing the data collection documentation was a valuable experience as it required structuring information clearly and making it accessible for future reference.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  
One challenge I faced was define data scope and collecting process. To address this, I collaborated with teammates to refine and standardize the process and improve documentation clarity make everyone clearly know how to collect the data and make a record list. Moving forward, I will continue to refine the data collection process and ensure that all logs and reports are properly maintained.

Overall, this week helped me improve my organizational and documentation skills as well as the data collecting skills communication within the team.
