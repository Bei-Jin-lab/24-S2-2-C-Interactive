# Week10 IndividualReflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- This week’s main task was to present our progress in a presentation. I was responsible for preparing and showcasing the SharePoint solution, as well as participating in meetings to discuss the structure of our slides.
- I added issues to the risk log and task log.
- During our rehearsal, we noticed some overlapping content due to the fact that we had worked independently. Additionally, we had different opinions on how the slides should be adjusted.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- I realized that simply suggesting how to modify someone’s work may not always be well received. Offering help and showing willingness to work together on changes improves communication and fosters better collaboration.
- In the future, I will make a conscious effort to approach discussions with a mindset of collaboration. Rather than only giving feedback, I’ll offer support in making improvements to ensure smoother teamwork and clearer communication.
