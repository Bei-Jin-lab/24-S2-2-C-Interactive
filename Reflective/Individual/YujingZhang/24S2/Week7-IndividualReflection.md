### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- This week, I focused on reading SharePoint's product documentation and SPFx framework documentation for custom development. I also attempted to set up the local development environment but encountered a requirement for a tenant account, which can only be created by an organization.
- I tried embedding a chatbot using embed code, but external connections need to be reviewed by the tenant administrator.
- I wrote 3 SharePoint solutions in TechnologySolutions.md and list risk, how, the advantages/disadvantages,cost,estimated time for comparing and choosing.
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- I realized the importance of initiating the deployment process early, as many challenges only become apparent at this stage.
- The need to coordinate with the ITS team became clear, especially for obtaining necessary permissions for external integrations like the chatbot.
- Moving forward, I will prioritize setting up the development environment and obtaining the necessary access rights as early as possible, to prevent bottlenecks later in the process.
