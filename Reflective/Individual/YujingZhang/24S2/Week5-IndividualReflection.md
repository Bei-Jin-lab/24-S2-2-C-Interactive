### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- Based on the feedback from this week's tutorial, I created a Reflection template and a Weekly Report template to improve our documentation efficiency.
- I also sort communication records with stakeholders and created a corresponding feedback log in our project, and added backend risk log.
- Added Features part in SOW.
- Added tutor's feedback to feedback log from audit.
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
Reflecting on this week, I learned the importance of proactively improving our processes. By gathering feedback from stakeholders and team members, I was able to enhance our communication flow and document management.Especially the importance of each log. This proactive approach allowed us to identify and solve issues quickly, which I believe significantly boosted our team’s efficiency and collaboration. Additionally, by applying the knowledge from the 6120 course on development processes, I was able to practically implement what I’ve learned about Agile like from the user stories to generate features. This experience has given me a deeper understanding of how these concepts work in real-world scenarios.
