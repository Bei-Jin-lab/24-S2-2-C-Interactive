### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- I had discussions about the tech stack in the backend and the documentation process with the team.
- I scribed the meetings with the team, tutor, and client, ensuring all key points were captured.
- I created a meeting template to streamline future meetings and improve documentation efficiency.
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
Through these activities, I learned the importance of clear communication and well-organized documentation in ensuring everyone is on the same page. Creating the meeting template helped standardize our process, making it easier to follow and maintain in future meetings. This experience also reinforced the value of detailed note-taking during discussions to prevent misunderstandings and ensure all actions are properly tracked.
