* Can use bullet points or write a summary (answer belows question)

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.
- In the seventh week, I completed the development of the project homepage using React, adding many dynamic effects. Compared to the previous WordPress and SharePoint versions, React provided a better user interaction experience, making the homepage more dynamic and responsive.
- However, due to security issues with the React version, we could not obtain ANU's domain and server support. In light of these problems, we decided to abandon the React version of the project and instead continue with the WordPress and SharePoint versions to ensure the project meets security requirements and gains support.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- This week, I realized the importance of security in the development process. Although React has many functional advantages, choosing a more secure and stable platform is crucial. In the future, I will focus more on project security while continuing to improve my development skills on different platforms.
