### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.
- This week, I developed the project homepage using SharePoint, focusing on layout and meeting the client's requirements.
- I encountered challenges with SharePoint’s interface and customization, which were not intuitive. Moreover, online resources were scarce, making it difficult to find solutions.
- To address these issues, I relied on trial-and-error and official documentation, though the latter offered only basic guidance. I also searched developer forums, but SharePoint’s community support was limited, slowing down problem-solving.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- This week, I learned to be adaptable and persistent when working with complex platforms like SharePoint. Despite the obstacles, I improved my problem-solving skills and plan to continue deepening my knowledge of SharePoint for future development.
