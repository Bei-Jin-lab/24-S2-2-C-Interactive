- In the fifth week, I summarized our previous work. After comparing various website building methods and communicating with the client, we decided to first use a local development method to create a homepage demo to present to the client.
- After this week's course tutorial, I realized that there are many issues in our completed work that need to be corrected. The issues that need to be addressed include:
1.We need to add personal reflections.
2.We need to include dates in the RISK LOG.
3.We need to use an Engineering log to record our working hours.
4.We need to create a Feedback log.
5.We need to produce a weekly report to summarize the work done each week.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- This week, I learned the importance of summarizing our work. I believe that setting the tasks for the upcoming week during our weekly meetings, and then summarizing the work accomplished in the following week's meeting, is crucial. This practice helps us have a clear understanding of the tasks that need to be done each week, ensuring that our work stays on the right track
