### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- In the third week, I primarily focused on comparing the pros and cons of different website-building methods, including traditional coding, WordPress, GitHub Pages, and SharePoint. After conducting this analysis, I presented our findings and recommendations to the client. One challenge I encountered was ensuring that the comparisons were relevant to the client's needs and project requirements. To address this, I maintained close communication with the client to understand their priorities and tailored the analysis accordingly. This approach helped me provide more accurate and useful recommendations.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- This week, I learned the importance of thoroughly evaluating different options before making a recommendation, especially when multiple approaches can be applied to a project. By considering the specific needs of the client and the context of the project, I improved my ability to provide well-informed advice. Additionally, I realized the value of clear communication with the client to ensure that our recommendations align with their expectations and goals. This experience has reinforced my understanding of the importance of adaptability and client-focused decision-making in project management.
