### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- In the fourth week, I created the prototype for our website. I was mainly responsible for the login and registration interfaces, as well as the homepage. While designing the prototype for the login interface, I realized that we should communicate promptly with the backend team. For example, we need to discuss whether we should add a feature that allows users to log in with their Google accounts.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- This week, after presenting our prototype to the client during the meeting, we received some valuable feedback. The client provided several suggestions for improving our design, which gave us new perspectives on how to refine our prototype. Additionally, we discussed the issues related to the domain name and server, which helped clarify our next steps. Through this experience, I learned the importance of actively engaging with the client to ensure that our work aligns with their expectations. It also reinforced the need for clear communication to address technical concerns promptly, ensuring that our project progresses smoothly.
