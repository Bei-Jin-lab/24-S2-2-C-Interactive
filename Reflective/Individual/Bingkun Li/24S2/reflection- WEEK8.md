### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.
- In the eighth week, I was primarily responsible for communicating with ANU IT about the website plugins and requesting an account with higher permissions. I also integrated the React version of our project and successfully uploaded the code to GitHub for future reference and collaboration.
- One of the challenges was obtaining the necessary permissions from ANU IT to install and manage plugins on the WordPress site. After several rounds of communication and providing details about our project needs, I managed to clarify the requirements but had to adjust our approach due to their security policies.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- This week, I improved my communication skills, especially in negotiating with IT departments to resolve permissions and plugin management issues. Additionally, I learned how to efficiently manage code integration and version control using GitHub, which will be crucial for future collaborative development efforts.
