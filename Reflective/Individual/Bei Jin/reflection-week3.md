### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- This week, I analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of the case website given to us by the tutor. I studied how to avoid these disadvantages for the website we want 
to build, and how to improve the performance of the website. I analyzed some risks that may be faced and the harmfulness of these risks. 

- Based on the fact that ANU has not yet effectively responded to our domain name application, we have proposed a plan for follow-up work.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- I learned that the UI interface of the website built by SharePoint is too simple. Although the shared links or resources can be directly obtained, the web page
  interface is not beautiful, which may affect the user experience. The customer also agrees with this point.
- On the other hand, the page created by wordpress is very
  simple and beautiful, but users cannot use some complex operation functions. Customers also reported that the module for adding/deleting permissions disappeared on
  the website created by wordpress.
