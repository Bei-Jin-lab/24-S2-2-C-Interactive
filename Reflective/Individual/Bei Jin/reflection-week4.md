### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- ANU will not approve our domain name application for security reasons. Based on this situation, we analyzed the advantages and disadvantages of two different technologies for creating websites (wordpress/react) and reported this to users in a timely manner.
- Facing the risk that ANU will not approve our domain name application in the end, after group discussion, we came up with a possible solution. That is, replace the existing domain name, delete the existing website content, and use react to edit and create a brand new website.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

-I learned that using WordPress may cause security issues. Since WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) in the world, it has become a prime target for hackers.
-At the same time, it is difficult for WordPress to achieve real-time data processing and complex API integration. Since this project requires the creation of an embedded AI chat box, it involves a lot of data processing.
-On the other hand, react can achieve complex permission management and role control. Because our project needs to create different management permissions according to different roles.
