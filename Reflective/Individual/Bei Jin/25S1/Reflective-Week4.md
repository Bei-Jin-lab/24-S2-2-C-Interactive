### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

This week, I manually collected data from the ANU website, summarizing its content and downloading relevant information. Since Python web scraping could not retrieve the data due to login restrictions, I had to rely on manual methods.

Challenges and Solutions:
Inability to use Python for automated scraping: The ANU website requires login authentication, making it difficult to extract data using Python.
Solution: I manually accessed the website and collected the necessary information to ensure data completeness and accuracy.
Large volume of data and time-consuming process: Manually gathering and organizing information took significant time and effort.
Solution: I adopted a systematic approach, using tools like Excel or Python for post-processing, structuring, and cleaning the data.
  
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- Improved data collection and organization skills: The manual process helped me develop a more efficient way of searching, extracting, and structuring information.
- Enhanced proficiency in data management tools: While data collection was manual, I utilized Python for further processing and analysis to increase efficiency.
- Gained a better understanding of website structures and access limitations: This experience deepened my knowledge of website authentication mechanisms, which could help in exploring more advanced scraping methods, such as login simulation, in the future.
