### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- Based on the decision to build a website using react, I analyzed how to make it easier for subsequent ANU staff (new to programming) to maintain the website in order to meet this need of the client.
- Learn how to build a website using react and implement some complex functions (hierarchical navigation) through react. 
- meet with shadow team. 

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- I learned some possible strategies to make it easier for programmers to maintain websites

  1. Use a content management system (CMS) integrated with React

  2. Use a low-code/no-code platform
  Migrate some functions to a low-code platform (such as OutSystems, Bubble), so that even if users have no programming experience, they can achieve simple updates and 
  extensions through drag and drop and configuration.

  3. Provide detailed documentation
 
- I realized that the navigation interface of the log is too confusing, and the font format of the entire page is different. These aspects need to be improved
