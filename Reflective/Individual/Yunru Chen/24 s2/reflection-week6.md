### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

In the sixth week of the project, I took on significant responsibilities that involved both technical and documentation challenges. My primary task was to collaborate with the backend team to address issues emerging from the integration of our React solution. This involved extensive coordination and problem-solving to ensure that the backend infrastructure supported the frontend effectively.

One significant risk was the lack of domain and permission grants from ANU ITS, which could potentially delay our project's deployment. After discussing this issue in meetings and gathering feedback from our tutor, convener, and client, we decided to begin development locally. This approach allowed us to progress without waiting for permissions, planning to migrate our project to the ANU servers once approvals were secured.

Another critical risk identified was the potential for cyber threats, which posed a significant threat to the security of our application. Feedback from the tutor and client emphasized the need for robust security measures. Consequently, we decided to use React not only for its efficiency but also for its strong security features, which include protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS (Cross-Site Scripting).

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

Dealing with the domain and permission issues taught me the importance of flexibility and strategic planning in project management. Developing locally as an interim solution was a crucial decision that kept the project timeline on track without compromising on regulatory requirements.

In consolidating several of the major risks faced by our team and the feedback received from various parties in response to that risk, and in finalizing our team's targeted decision-making process, I learned the importance of engaging with stakeholders effectively. Gathering and integrating feedback from tutors, conveners, and clients was instrumental in making informed decisions that aligned with everyone's expectations and project objectives.
