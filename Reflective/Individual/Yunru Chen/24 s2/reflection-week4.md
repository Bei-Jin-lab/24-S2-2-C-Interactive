# Week 4 Individual Reflection 
**Name**:  Yunru Chen



### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- Collaborated with backend team members to finalize the technology stack for our database, deciding on Spring Boot and SQL. This required aligning our backend needs with the capabilities of these technologies to ensure robust and scalable solutions.
- Reworked our project management approach to better align with agile development practices. This involved restructuring our workflows and timelines to enhance flexibility and responsiveness.
- Defined the key features of the project with team members, ensuring everyone was clear on the deliverables and their respective responsibilities.
- Attended tutorial, gathering valuable insights from tutor which were critical for our project's progression. I listened carefully to the feedback we received from tutor and wrote this week's reflection with this in mind.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- I gained deeper technical insights into using Spring Boot and SQL for backend development, understanding how these technologies can be optimized for our project needs.
- Enhancing our project's agility has improved my ability to adapt and re-plan, which are crucial skills in dynamic project environments.
- The process of defining features with the team reinforced my skills in collaborative planning and reinforced the importance of clear and concise communication.
- Listening to and incorporating feedback from our tutor was a valuable learning process; it not only helped in refining our approach but also in understanding the importance of external perspectives in project development.
