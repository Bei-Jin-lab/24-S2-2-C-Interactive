### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

During the eighth week, Jinghan Gao and I took a significant step forward in our project by addressing the licensing issues related to the integration of Chatbase, a chatbot platform. Given that the College of Asia and the Pacific (CASS) at ANU had already implemented Chatbase on their websites, we decided to pursue the same solution, assuming it would meet our needs effectively.

One primary challenge was ensuring we had the proper authorization to use Chatbase within our project’s framework under ANU’s IT policies. To tackle this, we reached out directly to ANU IT support to inquire about the specific licensing requirements and any existing agreements that could facilitate our usage of Chatbase. Leveraging the precedent set by CASS, we meticulously gathered details about their implementation, which strengthened our case when discussing the possibilities with IT support. This approach helped clarify the scope of permitted usage and ensured our project remained in compliance with institutional policies.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

Communicating with ANU IT support taught me the importance of clear, precise, and informed communication, especially when it involves technical and licensing terms. This skill is crucial for ensuring all stakeholders have a shared understanding and agreement on project implementations.

Working closely with Jinghan Gao on this issue emphasized the importance of teamwork in solving complex problems. Sharing responsibilities and combining our knowledge for the licensing inquiry made the process more manageable and successful.
