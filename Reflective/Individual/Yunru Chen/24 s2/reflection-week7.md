### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

In the seventh week, I partnered with Yujing Zhang to develop a SharePoint-based website prototype. Our goal was to create a functional and user-friendly interface that could efficiently manage content and provide a seamless user experience.

One of the primary challenges we faced was SharePoint's inherent limitations in its out-of-the-box features, which were insufficient for our specific needs, such as implementing a draft box and history browsing capabilities.

To overcome these limitations, we explored SharePoint's development capabilities, including the use of SharePoint Framework (SPFx) and PowerShell scripts. This approach allowed us to create custom solutions that integrated the required functionalities into our prototype. For example, we developed custom web parts for the draft box that interfaced with SharePoint's backend to store and retrieve drafts effectively.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

Working on SharePoint introduced me to its complex ecosystem, where I learned to navigate its capabilities and restrictions. Developing custom features using SPFx and PowerShell was particularly enlightening, expanding my technical toolkit.

The challenge of dealing with SharePoint's limitations taught me to think creatively and seek alternative solutions when standard tools do not meet the project's needs. This has improved my ability to adapt to various software environments and tailor solutions based on available resources.

Working closely with a group member on a complex project helped refine my collaborative skills. It emphasized the importance of clear communication and shared understanding in achieving common goals, particularly in a development setting where integration of different components is crucial.
