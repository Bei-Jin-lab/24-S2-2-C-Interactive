# Week3 Individual Reflection 
**Name**:  Yunru Chen



### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- This week, I worked closely with my team members to finalize our front-end technology choices, which was a critical decision point for our project. We evaluated various frameworks and libraries to ensure our choice aligns with the project requirements.
- I also engaged with ANU IT Support to request backend database access. This required careful planning and clear communication to ensure we met the security and operational standards necessary for user account login authorizations.
- I took on the responsibility of drafting our weekly group reflections. This involved summarizing our progress and challenges.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- I improved my collaborative decision-making skills through the front-end technology selection process. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each option and discussing these with the team was highly educational.
- Engaging with back-end group and ANU IT Support taught me the importance of clear and professional communication, especially when dealing with technical requirements and external departments.
- Writing the group reflections enhanced my ability to reflect critically on our work, articulating both our successes and areas for improvement effectively.
