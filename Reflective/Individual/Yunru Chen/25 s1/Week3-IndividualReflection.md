# Week 3 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

Today, I actively participated in two separate meetings—one with the client and another with our tutor, Zara. My primary focus was to understand clearly the client's requirements for the project as well as Zara's expectations for our progress. Additionally, I collaborated with the team to allocate tasks for the upcoming sprint. A particular challenge arose when some team members indicated their limited availability during certain future periods. I addressed this challenge by expressing my understanding and willingness to help by taking on additional responsibilities where necessary.Today, I actively participated in two separate meetings—one with the client and another with our tutor, Zara.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

Through these interactions, I enhanced my ability to interpret stakeholder requirements clearly and efficiently. I gained a deeper appreciation for flexibility and proactive teamwork, particularly in managing the team's workload when facing varying schedules and availability. My commitment to supporting the team has reinforced my collaborative skills and has emphasized the importance of adaptability in ensuring project success.
