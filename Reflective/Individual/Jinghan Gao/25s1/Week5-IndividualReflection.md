# Week 5 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, our team continued working on data collection. In addition to the data we gathered last week, our main task was to organize all the Q&A content from SharePoint into a structured document. We also aimed to compile as much information as possible related to Canvas, ensuring comprehensive data collection.
To accomplish this, we used all the links provided by the client and either manually extracted relevant content or wrote scripts to automate the process. One challenge was ensuring that no relevant information was overlooked. To solve this, we coordinated as a team to systematically go through all sources and cross-check our findings to ensure completeness.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week, I learned more about data collection and how to collaborate with my team effectively to gather and organize large amounts of information. Unlike my previous experience, where I typically started with a pre-existing dataset and focused on data cleaning, this project required me to take the first step—data collection—myself. This experience gave me a deeper understanding of how crucial and challenging data collection is for AI model training. Moving forward, I will apply this knowledge to ensure that the data we collect is well-structured and useful for training our chatbot.
