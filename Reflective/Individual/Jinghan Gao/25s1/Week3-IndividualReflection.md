# Week 3 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, we held a team meeting to finalize each memberâ€™s responsibilities for the semester. My main task is to train the AI chatbot and integrate it into our webpage. Additionally, we met with our tutor to define the tasks and goals for Sprint 1. We also had a client meeting, where we confirmed the project timeline and deliverables for this semester. Based on the client's requirements and the Sprint schedule, our team established a clear plan for each development cycle.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week helped me gain a clearer understanding of my tasks and the project's overall requirements. Through discussions with the team, tutor, and client, I realized the importance of aligning development milestones with both client expectations and sprint cycles. I also started learning more about AI chatbot training, which is essential for my role in the project. Moving forward, I plan to deepen my understanding of chatbot training methods to ensure a smooth integration into our webpage.
