# Week 9 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I evaluated Chatbase and Azure Bot service as potential chatbot solutions for our project. Due to ANU's whitelist restrictions, Chatbase cannot be deployed on SharePoint, so I have temporarily implemented it on WordPress. While Azure Bot  may supports deployment on both platforms, I encountered registration issues with my account, which limited our immediate use of this option. Given these constraints, we decided to proceed with Chatbase, despite its limitations in the free version, including restricted training capacity and limited inquiry allowances. We’re awaiting client approval for testing funds to overcome these limitations and enhance training capabilities.

One significant issue with Chatbase is its multilingual capabilities, which could rapidly deplete our usage quota since our website is intended to be English-only. Additionally, the chatbot currently answers questions unrelated to the site, highlighting the need for filtering mechanisms.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week underscored the importance of understanding platform-specific constraints, such as whitelist policies and language capabilities. I gained insights into how these factors impact the functionality and user experience of our chatbot solution. Moving forward, I plan to address the current issues by implementing more targeted question filtering and exploring ways to align the chatbot's capabilities more closely with the platform’s English-only requirement. I will also continue to coordinate with the client regarding funding for more extensive testing and training to refine our chosen solution.
