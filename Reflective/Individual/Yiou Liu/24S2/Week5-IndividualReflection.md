# Week5 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Yiou Liu


### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- Prepared the agenda for the client meeting, focusing on backend-related topics.
- Discussed with the client the prioritization of backend features and identified that the main priority is to implement the website's core functionalities rather than the login and registration feature.
- Decided that the login and registration feature can be addressed later, after the website's main functionalities are developed, and then negotiate with ANU IT regarding the use of their authentication system.
- Wrote and revised the weekly reports for Weeks 3-5 of our project, ensuring the reports accurately reflected the team's progress.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- Improved my ability to prioritize tasks by understanding the client's needs and adjusting the project's focus accordingly.
- Enhanced my communication skills by effectively discussing and aligning project priorities with the client during meetings.
- Gained experience in writing and revising project reports, ensuring they accurately reflect the team's work and progress.
