# Week 7 Group Reflection
### What Have Been Done?

Upon returning from a two-week holiday, our team promptly set out to create web prototypes using three distinct platforms: SharePoint, WordPress, and React. Each platform was selected based on its unique strengths, aiming to provide our client with multiple viable solutions for their project needs. We developed each prototype diligently, focusing on demonstrating the core functionalities that align with the project's goals. Subsequently, we crafted a detailed comparison table that outlined the advantages and disadvantages of each platform. This table was presented to the client, facilitating an informed discussion about the potential fit of each solution for their organizational needs.



### What Challenges and How Did We Solve Them?

### Challenges and Solutions

One of the major challenges we encountered after presenting our prototypes was the client's indecision between SharePoint and WordPress. This indecision made it difficult to proceed with a definitive development plan, as each platform catered to different aspects of the client's requirements. Additionally, the inherent differences in platform capabilities posed a challenge, as each has its own set of strengths and limitations. This diversity made it challenging to develop prototypes that could comprehensively meet all the client's requirements without compromising on functionality or user experience.

To address these challenges, we adopted a dual development strategy. Recognizing the client's difficulty in choosing between SharePoint and WordPress, we decided to continue the development of prototypes on both platforms. This approach allowed us to not only refine each platform according to the client's evolving feedback but also expand on the basic functionalities to better meet the project's goals. Further, this strategy ensured that we could adapt the final product more closely to the client's needs, offering a flexible solution that could be adjusted as more information and preferences were clarified.

In addition to the dual development approach, we significantly enhanced our communication with the client. By increasing the frequency of updates and discussions, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the client's priorities and expectations. This improved communication helped us to more effectively align our development efforts with the client's vision and to optimize each platform to better suit their needs. Through these discussions, we could address any concerns in real-time and adjust our strategies accordingly, ensuring a more targeted and client-focused development process.

This combination of a flexible development strategy and enhanced client communication proved crucial in overcoming the challenges we faced. It not only facilitated a smoother development process but also strengthened our relationship with the client, ensuring that the project remained on track to meet both their immediate and long-term needs.



### Areas for Improvement and Reflection

We could improve our initial analysis phase by predicting potential client indecisions and preparing more targeted presentations to help them make more informed decisions quicker. Enhancing our explanatory efforts regarding the technical and practical implications of each platform could help the client understand the long-term benefits and limitations of each option.

During this phase, the development of different web versions on multiple platforms highlighted the importance of agile project management practices. It also emphasized the need for clear and continuous communication, both within our team and with the client, to ensure that all stakeholders have a comprehensive understanding of the project's progress and outcomes. This reflective practice helps identify areas where our team can improve processes and results in future projects.
