# Week 6 Group Reflection
## What have been done? 

This week, we concentrated on Audit 3 and the presentation during the tutorial. The presentation was structured into several sections, each handled by different team members:

 \- **Introduction**: BeiJin introduced the project's importance, its necessity, and provided a client overview, detailing the next steps and responsibilities of each team member.

\- **Milestones, SOW, Team Chart**: Jinghan Gao was responsible for outlining the project's milestones, the statement of work (SOW), and the team chart, offering a comprehensive look at our progress and team dynamics.

\- **Other Sections**: Yunru Chen focused on critical project documentation including meeting records, reflections, weekly reports, feedback logs, task management, risk logs, and decision logs.

\- **Technology and Prototype**: Jinsong Xin and Bingkun Li were assessing different technological options, specifically the choice to use React, and continued developing the prototype.

\- **Backend Overview**: Yiou Liu and Yujing Zhang concentrated on the UML and database design, crucial for the backend structure.

 

## What challenges and how did we solve them?

\- **Coordination**: We aimed to clearly define goals and tasks, coordinating contributions from different team members to ensure a structured presentation. We managed this through weekly team meetings for discussions and used Canva as an online collaboration tool to track progress.

\- **Backend Technology**: Choosing React and other backend technologies led to significant challenges. The backend team needed to undertake research and consult with other tech advisors to learn and then refine the UML and system framework diagrams. This was done to clearly present our design philosophy and the development process.

 

## Areas for Improvement and Reflection

During our presentation, some inaccuracies in our slides and speech were highlighted, particularly regarding the cost implications associated with the SharePoint solution. A significant critique was our inability to effectively address on-the-spot questions about why SharePoint was deemed a costly option. This was primarily because our team had not delved deeply enough into understanding the full spectrum of SharePoint's extension plugin functionalities. While it's true that ANU provides the basic SharePoint tools for free, these tools fall short of meeting the requirements for the complex website we aim to build. This oversight in our preparatory research highlighted the need for a more advanced version of SharePoint, which requires a tenant account and additional purchases. This incident has been a learning opportunity for us to recognize the importance of comprehensive preparation and deeper technological understanding. Moving forward, we plan to enhance our research methods and ensure more rigorous preparation for addressing potential queries and challenges in future presentations and discussions.
