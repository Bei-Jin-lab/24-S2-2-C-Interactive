### Weekly Reflection

#### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- **Detailed Client Meeting Observations:** Our team successfully conducted a detailed client meeting which was also attended by our tutor, Andy. He reviewed our meeting notes and was impressed by the depth of detail we captured, discussing each point thoroughly which helps in maintaining transparency and continuity in project communications.
- **Task Allocation and Scheduling:** We defined specific tasks and assigned them to team members with clear start times. This methodical distribution of responsibilities is crucial for tracking progress and ensuring that every aspect of the project is progressing as planned.
- **Reflection Challenges:** While we managed to submit a group reflection, individual reflections were delayed. Andy stressed the need for more dynamic and detailed personal reflections rather than mere summaries to foster personal growth and deeper project understanding.

#### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- **Expanding the Decision Log:** Andy's feedback led us to realize the importance of an exhaustive decision log. We learned that it should not only document decisions related to code but also include decisions about team dynamics and project direction. This will help in future retrospectives and ensure every team member understands the rationale behind key project decisions.
- **Risk Management Enhancement:** We learned the significance of maintaining a detailed risk log with dates and clear, immediately recognizable entries. Differentiating between definite and potential risks allows for better preparation and response strategies. Incorporating insights from our meeting logs into the risk log ensures we are proactive rather than reactive.
- **Presentation Skills:** For the presentation in next week, we learned that when preparing for our project presentation, we should focus on creating engaging content that doesn't rely on simply reading from the slides. We also should aim to make our presentation interactive, with each team member actively participating, which not only makes the presentation more interesting but also demonstrates our cohesive team effort.

#### 3. Additional Insights and Next Steps:

- **Feedback Logs:** We discussed the importance of a structured feedback log that captures not just the feedback but also our reactions and adaptations to it. Distinguishing between team member inputs (reflections or decisions) and external feedback is crucial for clarity. Additionally, maintaining an engineering log helped us track hours spent, which is critical for assessing effort and efficiency.
- **Weekly Report:** The weekly report was expanded to include not just visible activities but also behind-the-scenes efforts, providing a comprehensive view of our work each week. This exhaustive reporting helps in identifying unacknowledged efforts and ensuring they are recognized and adjusted in future plans.
- **Dynamic Presentation Preparation:** For the upcoming presentation, we are focusing on ensuring that it is not only informative but also retains audience interest throughout. Planning for a dynamic presentation involves strategic content placement and rehearsing to maintain a steady pace and engaging delivery.
