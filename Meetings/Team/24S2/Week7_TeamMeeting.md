## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1: Discussion of division of labor
During this agenda item, our team discussed the challenges of identifying the best technical solution based on feedback from the client and results from Audit 2. It was acknowledged that each potential technology—WordPress, SharePoint, and React—has its strengths and weaknesses, and there is no single solution that perfectly meets everyone's needs.

To address this, our team proposed a strategy: over the next three days, each member would work on creating a demo of the assigned technology. The demos will be evaluated based on criteria such as security, scalability, cost, and other relevant factors. A detailed comparison table will be created listing the pros and cons of each technology. This comparison will be presented in the client meeting on Monday to allow the client to make an informed decision on which technology to use for the project.

Key issues identified for each technology include domain management, scalability, and costs associated with licenses or subscriptions.

#### Agenda-2: distribution of specific tasks  
The tasks were divided among the team members in Action Items.

Each group will be responsible for creating a demo, conducting an analysis of the assigned technology, and documenting their findings. This includes preparing a list of pros and cons and providing a comprehensive score for each technology based on predefined criteria.

In addition, our team discussed the need to secure funding from the client, especially if WordPress or SharePoint is chosen, as both options would require additional expenses for licensing and customization. There was also an agreement that funding would be needed for training the AI chatbot required for the project.

Our team concluded by setting clear deadlines and emphasizing the importance of thorough preparation for the upcoming client meeting to ensure that the best decision can be made collaboratively.
