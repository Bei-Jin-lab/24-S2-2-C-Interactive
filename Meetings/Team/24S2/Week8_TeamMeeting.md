## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1: Discuss progress on the WordPress, SharePoint
Jinsong Xin and Yiou Liu reported on the progress of the WordPress project, noting that basic functions like navigation, article publishing, and search have been implemented. The next steps include integrating security plugins and improving the user interface.

Yujing Zhang provided updates on the SharePoint project, emphasizing the convenience of using existing ANU infrastructure. The focus is now on supplementing content and improving page design, particularly in terms of navigation and user experience.

Our team discussed the importance of synchronizing content and design across WordPress and SharePoint to facilitate a deeper comparison between the two platforms.

#### Agenda-2: Review chatbot integration and related issues 
Jinghan Gao discussed the ongoing research into AI chatbot options, mentioning several potential plugins. Further communication with ANU IT is necessary to ensure the chosen solution complies with university policies and security requirements.

The team collectively discussed the focus for the coming weeks, which includes completing the comparison table of chatbot options and conducting further technical analysis. Our team decided that there is no immediate rush to make a final decision, and our team should use the available time to conduct thorough research and propose optimized solutions.

On October 4th, there was also a deadline for the showcase video, where our team discussed the personnel involved in the poster (Yunru Chen and Jinghan Gao) and the video (Bingkun Li and Bei Jin)
