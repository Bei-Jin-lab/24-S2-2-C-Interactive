## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1: What are the gaps in the overall analysis of existing documents
Bingkun Li initiated the discussion by asking if there were any significant gaps or updates needed for the existing documents related to the project. He asked if anyone had reviewed the documents in detail to identify any discrepancies.
Bingkun Li suggested that the team proceed based on the previous version of the documents unless new issues or differences are identified during the final review. He shared his screen to quickly walk through the documents and code, confirming that nothing major was missing from the last audit.

Bingkun Li reminded our team about the code submission for the audit and confirmed that his React code had already been uploaded. He asked Jinsong Xin and Yiou Liu about the status of their WordPress code submissions.
Jinsong Xin said that he had not yet uploaded his code but promised to do so shortly. 
Yiou Liu mentioned having added a small piece of PHP code at the end of a document but had not yet uploaded it. 

Bingkun Li asked if there were any new decisions or feedback to be logged. After a brief discussion, it was concluded that no major updates were needed for the decision log.
Regarding the feedback log, Bingkun Li mentioned that they needed to update the log with the most recent client and shadow team feedback. Jinghan Gao agreed to take responsibility for this.

#### Agenda-2: Discuss presentation content
Our team discussed the structure and focus of the upcoming presentation, which will highlight their progress over the semester. Bingkun Li emphasized the importance of addressing both accomplishments and challenges.
He noted that it was critical to explain the projectâ€™s pivot, particularly the switch to deploying on SharePoint, and the reasoning behind the changes in strategy. This should include an explanation of the work done before and after the change, highlighting any lessons learned.

Jinghan Gao mentioned that the AI component of the project would play a significant role in the future plans, and this should be a major point in the presentation. The team discussed the best way to position the AI work within the broader context of the project.
Bingkun Li suggested that after presenting the progress on WordPress and SharePoint, they should introduce the AI component as part of the next steps for the project.

Yujing Zhang volunteered to present the SharePoint section, noting that the content was manageable and she could cover it within the allocated time. Our team discussed dividing speaking roles among those who were more comfortable with public speaking.

Bingkun Li recommended rehearsing the presentation at least once to ensure everything fits within the 25-minute time limit. He emphasized that timing is crucial to avoid exceeding the allocated presentation time.
The team agreed to conduct a rehearsal after finalizing the slides and content. The goal is to refine the presentation and ensure smooth delivery, especially considering the critical review from both clients and examiners.

Jinghan Gao mentioned that the feedback advising them not to show videos during the presentation. Instead, the focus should be on live demonstrations and explanations.
