## Meeting minutes

### Agenda-1: Introduce WordPress updates
Jinsong mentioned that they migrated the previous WordPress site and made some adjustments because the previous version had issues. During the migration, it was found that some plugins differed from the ones they were using, and the current version already has some new plugins, possibly provided by the IT department.

Yiou raised the need to implement a publishing feature on the site and discussed using the front-end plugin WP forms pro to allow users to submit content directly through a form.
Yiou said that WP forms pro sends content via email but doesn't directly post it. To enable posting functionality, an additional plugin like WP Post Submission is required. This would allow users to submit posts from the front end, which would then be published directly to the site’s homepage.
The cost of the WP forms pro plugin was discussed, with Yiou indicating that further review of the pricing is needed.

Bingkun emphasized that this functionality needs to be completed by Wednesday, as they plan to submit a video by Friday and would like to showcase this feature in the video.

Bei Jin shared issues related to the security plugin, pointing out that they currently lack the necessary permissions to add the security plugin. After reviewing the support documentation, it was confirmed that the permissions issue needs to be resolved.

Henry suggested contacting the IT department to obtain higher permissions to address the plugin installation problem.

The discussion concluded with a focus on the site’s security concerns. Jinsong emphasized that if the site is later connected to multiple ANU systems, security would become more critical, especially to prevent administrator accounts from being compromised. Therefore, using a security plugin is deemed essential.
Our team decided to contact ANU IT to resolve the permissions issue for installing the security plugin.



### Agenda-2: Show Wordpress demo and different plan
Jinghan introduced various popular chatbot options available on the market, including OpenAI's GPT, Rasa, Google's Dialogflow, and IBM's Watson.
- OpenAI GPT: Not recommended due to the high maintenance difficulty for non-technical staff and an estimated monthly cost of around $4,400, which is considered expensive.

- Rasa: While open-source and free, it requires extensive training, and the training results may not be as good as those of existing models. It also has higher maintenance difficulty compared to OpenAI GPT.

- Google Dialogflow: Supports basic Q&A training, but cannot modify its underlying model. It does allow voice input, which could be beneficial, with a monthly cost of around $200.

- IBM Watson: A more complex option that is difficult to maintain, making it less favorable.

Jinghan highlighted two preferred options that are easier to maintain and cost-effective:
- Microsoft Azure Bot Service: Developed by Microsoft, it could integrate with SharePoint without requiring ANU approval due to Microsoft’s inclusion on ANU’s software whitelist. However, registration attempts failed due to permission issues.

- Chatbase: Speaker 5 reached out to ANU IT to verify Chatbase’s approval, with IT passing the request to their internal cybersecurity team for review.

Registration issues were encountered due to permission problems when using an ANU student account. It is unclear whether a company account is required for this service.
Jinghan will investigate further to resolve the permission issue, noting that if Azure Bot Service is more effective than Chatbase, they will likely choose Azure. If not, Chatbase will be selected, pending ANU’s whitelist approval.

Jinghan mentioned that both Azure and Chatbase would cost less than $100 per month.
Bingkun asked about the process for reporting costs, particularly for previous plugins discussed by Yiou. Henry clarified that expenses and usage details should be emailed, along with any supporting links or documentation as attachments.
Our team discussed that initial testing costs could be a few hundred dollars per month to evaluate effectiveness.

### Agenda-3: Show Sharepoint demo and different plan
Yujing shared the SharePoint interface, and although some users could not access it, it was confirmed that the page required ANU account permissions to view. Henry noted that while the current interface allowed basic functionality such as adding comments, further configurations, like admin-only permissions, were still required.

Henry encountered challenges in sharing the link outside of the group due to permission restrictions. They explained that the page was accessible only to users with ANU-approved accounts, which complicated the sharing process.
Henry also emphasized that users would need to save the link or remember the domain to access the page directly.

The team discussed the possibility of choosing between two different platforms for integration. While the current workload was manageable, Bingkun mentioned that, eventually, one platform would be selected after further evaluation.
Henry highlighted the importance of staying flexible with the timeline, noting that the final decision could be delayed until more development work was completed.

The discussion shifted toward the project’s progress. It was confirmed that the team would continue working on the project until the end of the year, with more iterations expected after the current audit.
Bingkun indicated that both platforms would be demonstrated during the audit presentation, but the final decision on which platform to use could be delayed.

Hnery emphasized the importance of showcasing the project progress during the next audit, including any developments made on both platforms.
Our team discussed scheduling a meeting with their supervisor next Monday to review the progress and gather feedback.
