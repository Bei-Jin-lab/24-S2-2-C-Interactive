## Meeting minutes

### Agenda-1: Team Members' Introductions
Bei Jin began the meeting and then explained that the team had created a simple website model using SharePoint. He requested Bingkun Li to share and introduce the website to the team.

Bingkun Li responded promptly, agreeing to share his screen, Bingkun acknowledged the feasibility of creating the website with SharePoint but mentioned there were some challenges.
He elaborated on these issues, highlighting limitations within SharePoint: "SharePoint can only put the picture here, and when you click, it will just jump to another interface, but it can't support functions like we want to, such as a login function." Bingkun explained that while SharePoint allows jumping between pages, it lacks the ability to create more complex functionalities
Bingkun expressed his opinion on whether SharePoint was suitable for the project: "I think maybe using other tools to build the website would be better because SharePoint is too simple for our project's functionalities."
He emphasized how limited SharePoint was when it came to collaboration and interface design: "It only allows one person to design this website, and when others need to work on it, permissions must be granted."

After Bingkun finished his demonstration, Jinsong Xin agreed to share his screen, Jinsong introduced the functionalities of his website, starting with a brief description: "The first one is for the posting page."
He noted a significant issue with SharePoint: "There’s a big problem in SharePoint; I cannot find a typing function, so I just typed something manually."
Jinsong explained that he had tried adding chapters but was hindered by the limitations of SharePoint’s functionality, he proposed a potential solution for improving the platform’s capabilities: "Maybe we can find some other functions, like a text function, to fix this problem.
Jinsong also pointed out that SharePoint’s design limitations made it difficult to implement multiple elements on one page: "If I want to put content on both the left and right sides of a page, it cannot easily handle it because we can only design content line by line."
In conclusion, Jinsong suggested that our team might need to explore alternative frameworks or solutions: "Maybe we can use another framework later for more complex functions."

Yiou Liu continued explaining the limitations she encountered with SharePoint: "I found that SharePoint has several limitations. It is primarily designed for creating static pages and lacks the ability to handle interactive functionalities."
Yiou suggested using SharePoint as a prototype and implementing the actual website with different techniques: "Maybe we can use this website as a prototype and use other techniques to implement our website."

### Agenda-2: Henry's Response and Discussion on Platform Evaluation
Yujing Zhang mentioned that they needed more familiarity with the components of SharePoint, to which Henry responded, "Yeah, I know. But SharePoint, again, is a cloud system from my understanding."
Henry emphasized that using SharePoint may mitigate some security concerns compared to other platforms, "There’s minimum security concerns if we're using SharePoint compared to other sites."

Henry elaborated on why security should be factored into the decision-making process, "So again, maybe that's something you can put into the criteria, like assign a weighting to the security level."
He continued to explain that security is an important aspect to consider when delivering a final product he pointed out that if the platform has significant security concerns, "If anything is a huge security concern, then we may not even approve whatever you're doing, right? That’s also a huge risk to us."
Henry encouraged our team to formalize their evaluation process, "So again, I will highly recommend just putting everything down, listing all the criteria that you think is important, and assigning a weighting to each criterion and comparing everything together."

Bingkun Li mentioned the plan from the previous week, the cbe client will come to the meeting and see the demo. Henry reassured the team not to stress about the demo deadline, "Yeah, don't worry about that. Don't worry if you can’t deliver something. I mean, just don’t worry about it." He emphasized flexibility with deadlines: "We can 100% delay that."

Bingkun explained that they were comparing different tools for the project, Henry offered advice on how to proceed, "And then, yeah, we can start from there. Just pick the one that's most suitable for this project."Bingkun Li agreed.Henry reiterated the importance of justification.
