## Meeting Minutes

### Agenda 1: Website Functionality and Technical Implementation

* The tutor asked about the current website features and how they are aligned with user requirements.
* The team explained the approach to page categorization: instead of using a single page with filter logic, new dedicated pages are created for each category (e.g., News, Canvas, Seminars).
* This method supports high customization and flexibility for future updates.

### Agenda 2: Chatbot Version 1 & 2 Progress and Demonstration

* The team introduced both versions of the chatbot and outlined the technical upgrades from V1 to V2.
* A live demonstration was given to show that the chatbot now:

    * Accurately refers to original training materials
    * Minimizes over-creative responses
    * Connects responses with source data
    * Utilizes a structured training database
* The tutor acknowledged the backend improvements and confirmed the direction was appropriate.

### Agenda 3: Testing Plan and Client Feedback

* The tutor asked about how the team will conduct testing.
* The team noted that since most website functionalities were only recently completed, testing is scheduled for the coming week.
* The tutor also inquired about client feedback. The team confirmed it has been recorded and detailed in the Client Meeting Record.
