## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1: Introduced Project and Outcome of Last Semester
During the meeting, our team introduced our project and summarized the outcomes achieved last semester to our new tutor, Zara. We presented the current state of our website prototype, the landing page, and provided an overview of our logs documented on GitHub. Zara reviewed our progress and gained insight into the current project stage.


#### Agenda-2: Designed Functionality and Preparation for Next Sprint
We informed Zara about our recent meeting with the client held earlier on the same day. We communicated the client's specific requirements clearly. The client requested iterative updates to the existing Wordpress website, with particular emphasis on enhancing the AI chatbot functionality. These updates are scheduled to be delivered after the mid-break. Based on these requirements, our team will discuss internally each member’s responsibilities, along with defining clear objectives and functionality targets to be achieved in Sprint 1.
