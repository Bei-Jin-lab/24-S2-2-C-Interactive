## Meeting minutes
Agenda-1: Introduce our group's work for these 2 weeks
- Introduce the logs we added to the project, such as tasklog, personalreflective log, feedback log, weekly report.
- Show our modified landingpage
- Introduce the difficulties encountered in the current work (apply for a domain name)
- The front-end and back-end technologies selected (react and database)
 


Agenda-2: Receive some suggestions from shadow team 
- The shadow team reflected their views on the landing page:
 1. The landing page interface has made great progress. However, due to the large number of branches in the log, it is a bit messy. It may be better if it is arranged in a list format.
- The shadow team reflected their views on the log:
 1. The newly added log is very helpful for viewing project progress
- The shadow team reflected their views on the project's difficulties:
 1. Domain name application may involve security, and it is necessary to use a more secure technology to complete the website establishment
 2. React has a high requirement for programming level. Can the team members master this technology as soon as possible to complete the front end

  

Agenda 3: Check the shadow team's work for these 2 weeks
- The team was divided into two groups—three members focusing on the interface and four on logical components, preparing for Audit 3.
- The team developed visible outputs, including a homepage with navigation and a picture block page layout, laying the foundation for future expansion.
- The team successfully completed Audit 3 and received positive feedback on their organization, documentation, and presentation.
- Challenges: Unfamiliarity with Flutter: Many team members lack experience with Flutter, which poses a challenge, potentially leading to delays and bugs. Some team members focused on coding while others learned Flutter and worked on documentation to maintain project logs.
  

Agenda 4: Give some suggestions to shadow team     
- Flutter Training and Mentorship: Since unfamiliarity with Flutter is a significant challenge, consider organizing formal training sessions or pairing experienced team members with those less familiar. This peer mentorship can accelerate learning and ensure consistent progress. Additionally, utilizing online tutorials or official Flutter documentation could provide quick solutions to specific problems.

- Incremental Development and Testing: Break down development tasks into smaller, manageable parts and integrate frequent testing cycles. This approach can help catch bugs early, especially with the less familiar Flutter framework. It can also reduce pressure closer to deadlines and prevent major issues from accumulating.

- Clear Documentation and Logs: Continue focusing on maintaining detailed logs in GitHub, ensuring that both progress and challenges are well-documented. This will improve communication, help track decisions, and make it easier to onboard new team members or stakeholders.
