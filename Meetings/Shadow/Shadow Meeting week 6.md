## Meeting minutes
Agenda-1: Introduce our group's work for these 2 weeks
- Introdcue we focused on backend development with Java-Spring Boot, including system architecture and UML diagrams. This work was halted due to a shift in platform requirements.
- We shifted to SharePoint, developed the user interface, homepage, and custom web parts to adapt to SharePoint's limitations.
- Maintaining logs and preparing documentation in alignment with client feedback and the project’s updated goals on the SharePoint platform.
  


Agenda-2: Receive some suggestions from shadow team 

- Seek SharePoint development support, especially for integrating custom web parts and Power Automate workflows.

- Continue local development but maintain close coordination with ANU ITS to expedite server deployment approvals.
 

  

Agenda 3: Check the shadow team's work for these 2 weeks
- The team was divided into two groups—three members focusing on the interface and four on logical components, preparing for Audit 3.
- The team developed visible outputs, including a homepage with navigation and a picture block page layout, laying the foundation for future expansion.
- The team successfully completed Audit 3 and received positive feedback on their organization, documentation, and presentation.
- Challenges: Unfamiliarity with Flutter: Many team members lack experience with Flutter, which poses a challenge, potentially leading to delays and bugs. Some team members focused on coding while others learned Flutter and worked on documentation to maintain project logs.
  

Agenda 4: Give some suggestions to shadow team     
- Flutter Training and Mentorship: Since unfamiliarity with Flutter is a significant challenge, consider organizing formal training sessions or pairing experienced team members with those less familiar. This peer mentorship can accelerate learning and ensure consistent progress. Additionally, utilizing online tutorials or official Flutter documentation could provide quick solutions to specific problems.

- Incremental Development and Testing: Break down development tasks into smaller, manageable parts and integrate frequent testing cycles. This approach can help catch bugs early, especially with the less familiar Flutter framework. It can also reduce pressure closer to deadlines and prevent major issues from accumulating.

- Clear Documentation and Logs: Continue focusing on maintaining detailed logs in GitHub, ensuring that both progress and challenges are well-documented. This will improve communication, help track decisions, and make it easier to onboard new team members or stakeholders.
