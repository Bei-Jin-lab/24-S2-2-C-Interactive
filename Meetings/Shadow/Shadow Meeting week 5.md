Agenda-2: Receive some suggestions from shadow team 
- The shadow team reflected their views on the landing page:
 1. The layout of some content is not beautiful
 2. The classification of log files is not intuitive, which may cause the tutor to not find the corresponding files
 3. They expressed interest in AI-chatbox and asked about the use of related technologies
- The shadow team reflected their views on meetinglog and SOW:
 1. Keep records of meetings with clients and tutors.
 2. It is also necessary to describe the details of the meetings, which can also reflect the changes in the needs and interests of shareholders.
- Finish the rest of team charter

  

Agenda 3: Check the shadow team's work for these 2 weeks
- Learned about the shadow team's project: researching an app based on an existing webpage, which can control the actions of a toy dog ​​by dragging and dropping code modules. The purpose is to stimulate children's interest in code
- According to their SOW, milestone, and their overall arrangement, they hope to complete the construction of the basic app framework in the first semester as much as possible.
  

Agenda 4: Give some suggestions to shadow team     
- Landingpage is very well done, and there are many things we can learn from it
- Many logs are missing (decisionlog, risklog, etc.)
