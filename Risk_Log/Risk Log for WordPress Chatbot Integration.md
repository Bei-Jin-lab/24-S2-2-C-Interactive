**Decision Details**  
**Date**: 2024-10-04  
**Author**: Jinghan Gao,Jinsong Xin 

**Background**  
In our current project, to enhance the platform's user experience and interactivity, we plan to embed a chatbot feature in WordPress. The initial solution was to integrate Chatbase’s free version into the website using an iframe. While this approach was quick to implement, a few issues have arisen as the project progresses:

1. **Limit on the number of responses**: The free version of Chatbase imposes a limit on the number of chatbot responses, which is insufficient for our high-frequency user interactions.
2. **Accuracy issues**: The accuracy of the free model's responses is subpar, especially when handling complex questions. This can lead to incorrect or irrelevant answers, negatively affecting the user experience.
3. **Uncertainty with future upgrades**: We plan to upgrade to the paid version of Chatbase in the future, hoping it will address the limitations in response quantity and accuracy. However, we have not yet tested the features and performance of the paid version, particularly its compatibility with WordPress and its ability to meet our project’s requirements.
4. **WordPress built-in chatbot model not usable**: We attempted to use WordPress’s built-in chatbot model but encountered an issue where the system prompts that the account is not registered, making this option currently unavailable.

These issues not only affect the current project’s progress but also present potential risks for future chatbot functionality expansion and user experience.

**Decision Content**  
1. **Current solution**: We will continue to use the free version of Chatbase embedded via iframe as a temporary solution. Although there are limitations regarding response quantity and accuracy, it meets the basic needs of the project for now.
   
2. **Future considerations**: We plan to upgrade to the paid version of Chatbase in the future, expecting this upgrade to resolve the issues with response limitations and accuracy. Before implementing, we need to conduct thorough testing to ensure the paid version is compatible with WordPress and meets our project’s long-term needs. Additionally, a cost-benefit analysis should be conducted to ensure the solution remains within budget while delivering the desired user experience.

3. **Alternative solution research**: Since the built-in WordPress chatbot model is currently unusable due to the account registration issue, we will investigate other viable alternatives, including:
   - Exploring third-party plugins compatible with WordPress.
   - Reassessing the feasibility of utilizing WordPress’s internal chatbot model.

4. **Risk management**: While continuing to use the free version of Chatbase, we will closely monitor its impact on the user experience, especially under high-traffic conditions. We will also develop contingency plans to address the limitations of the free version, such as regularly monitoring and evaluating chatbot data to ensure that there are not too many unanswered queries.

**Conclusion**  
For now, we will continue using the free version of Chatbase as a temporary solution. Despite its limitations, it provides basic functionality during the early stages of the project. Meanwhile, we will begin planning to upgrade to the paid version of Chatbase and research other alternative solutions to ensure we can offer a high-quality user interaction experience in the future. To mitigate risks, we will keep monitoring user feedback and make necessary adjustments as needed.
