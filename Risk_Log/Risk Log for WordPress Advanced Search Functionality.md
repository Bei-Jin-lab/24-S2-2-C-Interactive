# Risk Log for WordPress Advanced Search Functionality

**Decision Details**  
**Date**: 2024-10-04  
**Author**: Bingkun Li

**Background**  
In the current project, we are using an advanced search bar feature from a WordPress plugin to enhance the website's search functionality. However, the current advanced search bar does not support conditional filtering or precise search queries. This issue negatively impacts the user experience, as the functionality remains incomplete, making it difficult for users to find the exact information they need. Additionally, it is uncertain whether these issues can be resolved in the future through updates or adjustments to the plugin.

**Decision Content**  
1. **Current Issue**: The advanced search bar within the existing WordPress plugin does not support key functions such as conditional filtering and precise searching, which are critical to improving the search experience.

2. **Possible Solutions**:
   - **Option 1**: Research and find a new plugin that supports the required search functionalities and ensures full compatibility with our current WordPress system.
   - **Option 2**: Use the code editing feature to implement custom code that enables conditional filtering and precise search capabilities to meet the project’s search requirements.

3. **Risk Management**: While searching for a new plugin or editing code, we need to test the feasibility of the solution to ensure it does not negatively impact the existing system. Additionally, contingency plans should be developed to address potential compatibility issues during the plugin replacement or code editing process.

**Conclusion**  
At present, our priority is to research new plugins as a solution, but we are also considering directly implementing the enhanced search functionality via code editing. We will continuously monitor user feedback and make necessary adjustments to ensure that the search functionality meets the project’s requirements.
