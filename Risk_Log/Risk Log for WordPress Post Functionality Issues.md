**Title**: Risk Log for WordPress Post Functionality Issues

---

**Decision Details**  
**Date**: 2024-10-04  
**Author**: Bingkun Li

**Background**  
In the current project, the Post functionality has been implemented by modifying the PHP framework to enable front-end post creation. However, this functionality is incomplete and contains several critical bugs. The issues currently encountered include, but are not limited to:

1. **Unable to categorize posts**: Posts cannot be organized into categories, which affects the content structure and display.
2. **Unable to upload publication date**: When publishing posts, the publication date cannot be set or modified, limiting the ability to manage time-based content.
3. **Unable to modify the author**: The post author cannot be changed, which is problematic for collaborative publishing.
4. **Restricted posting permissions**: Currently, only administrators can publish posts, while other users are unable to do so, greatly limiting the multi-user interaction functionality of the site.

These issues make the current Post functionality fall short of expectations, hindering the user experience and affecting the content publishing workflow.

**Decision Content**  
1. **Current Issues**: The Post functionality faces several key problems, including the inability to categorize posts, set publication dates, modify authors, and manage user permissions, which creates significant obstacles in managing and publishing content.

2. **Possible Solutions**:
   - **Option 1**: Research and try third-party plugins that can address the post functionality issues while ensuring compatibility with the existing WordPress architecture.
   - **Option 2**: Optimize the existing PHP framework by fixing the current bugs and adding features such as post categorization, publication date management, author modification, and user permission adjustments.

3. **Risk Management**: When implementing new plugins or optimizing the existing code, we need to consider the potential impact on the current system, especially ensuring that no new conflicts arise. Contingency plans should also be in place to handle potential technical issues, such as plugin incompatibility or ineffective code modifications.

**Conclusion**  
At this stage, our priority will be to research and attempt to use third-party plugins to resolve the current Post issues. If the plugins do not meet our needs, we will consider further optimizing the existing PHP code framework. We will continuously monitor the stability of these functions and user feedback, making adjustments as necessary to ensure the post functionality is fully realized.
