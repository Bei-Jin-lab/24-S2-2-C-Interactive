**Decision Details**  
**Date**: 2024-09-27
**Author**: Bei Jin

**Background**  
Due to insufficient permissions, our team is unable to install plugins on WordPress

1. Limited website functionality
Plugins are often used to extend the functionality of WordPress, such as adding SEO optimization, security protection, e-commerce features, etc. If you cannot install plugins, the functionality of the website will be severely limited, affecting the user experience and the satisfaction of business needs.

2. Increased security risks
Plugins (especially security plugins) can help enhance the security of the website and prevent hacker attacks and malware infections. If you do not have sufficient permissions to install the necessary security plugins, the website may be more vulnerable to attacks.

3. Performance issues
Some plugins can help optimize website performance, such as caching plugins and database optimization plugins. If these plugins cannot be installed, the website may load more slowly, affecting SEO rankings and user experience.

4. Unable to meet customized requirements
If customers or businesses have customized requirements, but cannot install plugins to meet these requirements, it may hinder project progress and even affect customer satisfaction.

**Decision Content**  
After asking ITs, they agreed to install the plugins for us. We just need to tell them which specific plugins need to be installed.

**Conclusion**  
For now, we will continue to use WordPress as a temporary solution. Although it has limitations, it provides basic functionality in the early stages of the project.
