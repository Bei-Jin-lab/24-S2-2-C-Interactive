# Risk Management
In terms of technical risks, there is a risk of inadequate model performance, where the AI model may not achieve the expected accuracy, leading to a decline in user experience. To cope with this risk, extensive model testing should be conducted at the initial stage, the optimal model can be selected, and multiple datasets can be utilized for model training and validation. If the model still fails to meet the expected accuracy, adopting more advanced model architectures or other methods to resolve this issue.

Potential risks also include Advanced Feature Limitations. Due to security measures imposed by ANU, there might be restrictions that prevent the implementation of some advanced features in the AI system. Planning for alternative solutions or adjustments in the project scope may be necessary to address these constraints.
 
In terms of data and privacy, there is also a risk. Sensitive data may be illegally accessed or leaked during transmission or storage. Data transmission and storage can be protected by implementing end-to-end encryption and using security protocols and best practices. It is also important to avoid non-compliant use of data during the collection and processing stages.
 
There are also operational risks, such as the system's compatibility and stability. Be aware that web pages can be opened on all devices. ai chatbot also has to be aware of possible service interruptions. Additionally, there is a risk of low user acceptance, which necessitates meeting user expectations and iterating updates based on users feedbacks.

Personnel changes also lead to potential risks. The leaving of team members or stakeholders poses a risk that can disrupt the continuity of a project and cause delays. Implementing strong succession and timely documentation can help mitigate this risk.
