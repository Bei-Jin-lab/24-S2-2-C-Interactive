# Project Reflection Week 3



1. **Compared with different front-end hosting solutions:**

   This week, our team conducted an extensive comparative analysis of various front-end hosting solutions, specifically focusing on WordPress, GitHub Pages with Jekyll, and traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript development. After thorough evaluation, we decided to proceed with WordPress due to its strong alignment with our project requirements. 

   Here are evaluation of several front-end solutions:

   - **Traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript Development**:

     Found to be too complex and costly for both initial development and ongoing maintenance, particularly due to the high level of technical expertise required.

   - **GitHub Pages and Jekyll**:

     Considered for its low-cost hosting and simplicity. However, its static nature and limited capability for dynamic content integration made it less suitable for our project needs.

   - **WordPress**:

     Selected for its ease of use, robust community support, and extensive plugin ecosystem. WordPress’s intuitive admin interface and familiarity to the CBE College enhance its suitability for our project, ensuring easier maintenance and future development.

2. **Client Website Analysis**:

   We analyzed a website shared by the client, identifying useful sections and elements that could be adapted or improved upon in our design. This analysis helped us decide on features to include and exclude, setting a foundation for customizing the new site.

3. **Backend Considerations**:

   - We discussed backend requirements extensively, particularly around user authentication and data storage.

   - Decisions were made to create our database instead of relying on existing structures.
   - We plan to contact ANU IT Support to discuss the possibility of integrating authentication services.

# Summary of This Week's Work
