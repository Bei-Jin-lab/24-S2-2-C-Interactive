# Project Reflection week2

Through self-study in the second week, team meetings, and client communication, we identified the following issues:

1. UI Design of the Old Website Needs Improvement
   During our discussions with the client, we realized that the user interface design of the old website has significant room for improvement. While it is functional, the user experience is not friendly enough. This made us recognize the need to focus more on aesthetics and usability in the new website design.

2. Chatbot Technology is More Challenging Than Expected
   We discovered that implementing intelligent AI chatbot technology is more challenging than anticipated. Specifically, to enable it to access the CBE College database and respond accurately to specific questions, we need to overcome many technical difficulties. This realization prompted us to reevaluate our technical approach and seek additional technical support.

3. Choice of Frontend Framework
   After intense discussion, we temporarily decided to use the React framework. At the same time, we considered Vue and Bootstrap frameworks as backup options. If we encounter problems with React, we can switch to the other frameworks as needed. This flexibility helps us address various technical challenges as the project progresses.

4. Backend Technology Selection
   We decided to use Firebase instead of a traditional database. This choice is based on Firebase's efficiency and ease of use, which better support our project needs.

5. Reevaluation of Project Complexity
   During Friday's class, the instructor's explanation made me realize that this project is not just a simple course assignment but a structurally complex project. We need to focus not only on the explicit requirements but also on understanding the implicit needs of the project. For example, stakeholder analysis is a very effective method. Our team decided to deeply understand the needs of CBE College students and teachers next week, making the project more user-oriented. Additionally, the project must be easy to maintain, as the CBE College may make subsequent changes to the project. Therefore, we must ensure the project is maintainable.

6. Importance of Team Collaboration
   I realized that this is not just a one-person project but a team project. It can only be completed through the joint efforts of the team. Each team member must communicate frequently during coding, which can greatly reduce code conflicts during project integration.

7. Collaboration with the Shadow Team
   I believe our shadow team is a good communication partner. Both teams can regularly communicate, supervise each other, and make mutual improvements. Through this collaboration, we can make progress together and improve the quality of the project.
