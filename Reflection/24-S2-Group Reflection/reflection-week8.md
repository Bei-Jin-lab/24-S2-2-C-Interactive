# Week 8 Group Reflection
### What Have Been Done?

This week, our team conducted an in-depth analysis of WordPress and SharePoint, categorizing each platform into specialized solutions tailored to our project's requirements. For SharePoint, we developed three distinct configurations: SPFx Local Development, SPFx Local Development + Handover, and Online Development + Embedded Chatbot (Chatbase). For WordPress, we divided the strategies into: WordPress with Basic Plugins, WordPress with ANU IT Integration (SSO), and WordPress with Custom Development. Each solution was thoroughly investigated to delineate its suitability for our clientâ€™s needs, taking into account various factors like functionality, scalability, and cost.



### What Challenges and How Did We Solve Them?

This week, our team faced significant challenges while delving into the configurations of the WordPress and SharePoint platforms, each presenting unique obstacles. To address these challenges, we adopted a segmented approach, categorizing each platform into more specific solutions. This strategy enabled us to identify the best possible solutions, ensuring that our chosen approaches were tailored to precisely meet the core requirements of the project while discarding unnecessary features. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of each solution. This in-depth analysis not only helped us understand the various technologies but also facilitated more informed decision-making by the client, ensuring they understood the implications and advantages of each proposed solution.

Additionally, we discovered that many solutions required contacting ANU IT Support to obtain their authorization. We divided our team into two groups, each reaching out to ANU IT Support to inquire about permissions for website embedding and chatbot integration into the whitelist. We also found that achieving a delicate balance between development costs and operational functionality was crucial, especially for configurations involving WordPress's Single Sign-On (SSO) and custom developments.



### Areas for Improvement and Reflection

Reflecting on our experiences, the importance of detailed platform analysis and proactive client engagement in technology selection has become increasingly apparent. We have gradually adapted to presenting the advantages and disadvantages of each option in a tabular format, which is crucial for ensuring that all stakeholders have a comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts of each decision. By improving these processes, especially during the critical stages of selecting technology platforms, we can significantly enhance our efficiency and responsiveness.
