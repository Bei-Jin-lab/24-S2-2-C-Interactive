# Week 9 Group Reflection
### What Have Been Done?

This week, our team advanced the version iterations of our existing solutions on both the WordPress and SharePoint platforms. On WordPress, we implemented a significant enhancement by embedding an AI chatbot that has undergone preliminary training, aimed at improving user engagement and automating responses. However, on the SharePoint side, our efforts to integrate a Chatbase chatbot were stalled due to authorization issues with ANU IT support.

Besides, we are also preparing for Audit3 and have also created a video and poster introducing our project.



### What Challenges and How Did We Solve Them?

This week, our team faced picks in the integration of technology and permissions that hindered the progress of our project. Licensing issues have become a key bottleneck, which has manifested itself in the integration of the Chatbase chatbot into SharePoint, which has stalled due to pending approvals from Australian National University IT support.
Additionally, we ran into roadblocks with our initial plans to embed the security plugin into our web pages. However, subsequent communication with ANU IT support revealed that security management was already under the purview of ANU IT, a discovery that led us to reevaluate our efforts and prompted us to shift our focus away from attempting to install the security plugin, a task outside of our control, and towards other areas where we could have a more immediate impact.

In response to these challenges, we took proactive steps to improve our communication with the ANU IT department. Our goal was to clarify and expedite the authorization process for future integrations, ensuring smoother project progression in subsequent phases. By adjusting our responsibilities and refocusing our efforts on aspects of the project within our control, we aimed to optimize our contributions and mitigate delays associated with external dependencies. This strategic pivot is intended to enhance our team's efficiency and effectiveness, allowing us to make meaningful advances in our project despite the complexities introduced by institutional IT policies.



### Areas for Improvement and Reflection

This week's reflection highlights the importance of several aspects of project management, particularly in how we work with institutional IT support and manage dependencies. We've recognized that it's critical to reach out to IT support as early as possible.

Additionally, we've learned the importance of enhanced planning for managing dependencies. Anticipating potential roadblocks, especially those related to external dependencies such as IT permissions, can significantly improve our project timelines and outcomes. This proactive approach in planning can help us identify potential issues early on, allowing for timely adjustments to our project strategies and deliverables.
