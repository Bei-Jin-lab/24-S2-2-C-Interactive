# Week 3 Group Reflection

### What Have Been Done?

As a team, we introduced our project and presented the outcomes of last semester, including the website prototype, landing page, and our detailed documentation on GitHub, to our new tutor Zara. Additionally, we clearly communicated the client’s specific requirements following our earlier meeting, particularly emphasizing iterative updates and enhancements to the AI chatbot functionality, which will form the basis of our next Sprint. 



### What Challenges and How Did We Solve Them?

One significant challenge was ensuring a clear and unified presentation of the project's history and current status to Zara, who was unfamiliar with our prior work. We overcame this by collectively preparing and organizing our materials to deliver a coherent and structured introduction. Another challenge was accurately capturing and interpreting the client's requests. We addressed this by carefully noting the client's feedback and discussing these details thoroughly as a team to ensure alignment and clarity for our upcoming tasks. 



### Areas for Improvement and Reflection

Reflecting on today’s discussion, we identified the importance of further refining our internal communication, especially regarding individual roles and responsibilities within upcoming tasks. We realized the necessity for more rigorous planning and clear definitions of deliverables to meet client expectations effectively. Enhancing our iterative processes and proactively managing client interactions will be areas of focus moving forward.
