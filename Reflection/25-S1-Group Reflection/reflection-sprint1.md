# **Sprint 1 Group Reflection**

### **What Have Been Done?**

During Sprint 1, our team made significant progress on both major components of the project: the AI chatbot development and the website interface design.

On the chatbot development side, we completed extensive data collection efforts through both manual sourcing and Python-based web scraping. The team successfully gathered over a thousand pieces of content from publicly accessible pages (e.g., Canvas) and SharePoint. To ensure the quality and relevance of the data, we also conducted cross-validation across sources, laying a strong foundation for subsequent training and testing of the chatbot.

On the website design side, we iterated through three versions of the site. The original version (v1.0) was developed at the end of the previous semester. Based on client-provided templates and feedback received on March 14 (Week 4), we released version 1.1, featuring refined layout, dynamic effects, chatbot access buttons, vertical side navigation, and light/dark mode toggle. Further feedback from Clients during an in-person client meeting on March 22 (Week 5) prompted another round of iteration, resulting in version 1.2. This update replaced the vertical navigation with a top horizontal navigation bar, added floating buttons, and re-focused the site on content over aesthetics, minimizing dynamic distractions. We also aligned the site's fonts, colors, and layout with ANU’s official branding guidelines.

### **What Challenges and How Did We Solve Them?**

Several key challenges emerged during this sprint:

- Access-restricted data collection: While scraping public content was relatively straightforward, SharePoint access restrictions prevented automation. We addressed this by switching to manual document screening and assessing relevance by hand.
- Data volume for chatbot training: Some PDF files from SharePoint exceeded memory limits, making them difficult to process. We are currently exploring content reduction and data compression strategies to work around these limitations.
- Client feedback on web design direction: Version 1.1 was deemed too animation-heavy and not content-focused enough. We responded by shifting focus to clear content display, removing unnecessary effects, and revising navigation based on practical feedback from our clients.

### **Areas for Improvement and Reflection**

Reflecting on Sprint 1, a few key areas for improvement emerged:

- More proactive communication with clients: Early engagement and regular feedback loops could help minimize major revisions later in the sprint.
- Better scoping of technical feasibility: In future, we aim to assess technical limitations (e.g., file sizes, access barriers) earlier during the planning phase to avoid mid-sprint bottlenecks.
- Internal coordination and role clarity: Thanks to Zara’s leadership in Week 5, individual roles and responsibilities have now been clarified to ensure workload equity and better task ownership.

As we enter the next sprint, our focus will be on training the chatbot using the cleaned dataset and conducting user testing on the website to ensure it meets both functionality and usability expectations.
