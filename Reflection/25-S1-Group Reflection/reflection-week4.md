# Week 4 Group Reflection
### What Have Been Done?

This week, our team completed the necessary data collection to support our project goals, which is the first step in training the AI chatbot. After concluding our client meeting and orientation session, we clearly defined and executed tasks that delineated responsibilities for user interface improvements and chatbot training. The data collection tasks focused in particular on gathering relevant material from publicly available web pages on the Internet and SharePoint, which set the stage for our upcoming sprint phase.



### What Challenges and How Did We Solve Them?

We faced several challenges during data collection. While we successfully automated data extraction from publicly accessible Canvas content using web scraping methods, difficulties arose when dealing with SharePoint, which required secure university logins. Unable to automate this process, we resorted to manual screening to determine the relevance of each document. Additionally, another significant issue emerged regarding the large volume of PDF files downloaded from SharePoint, which exceeded the memory limits for AI model training. Currently, we are exploring alternative solutions such as data compression or selective content reduction to address this problem.



### Areas for Improvement and Reflection

Reflecting on this week's challenges, we recognized the importance of advanced preparation when handling access-restricted resources and large-scale data. Moving forward, we will enhance our planning strategies to better anticipate and manage data processing limitations. Additionally, improving our approach to manual document screening and exploring more efficient AI training methodologies will be prioritized to ensure smoother progress in future sprints.
