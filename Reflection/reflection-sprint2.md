# **Sprint 2 Group Reflection**

### **What Have Been Done?**

During Sprint 2, our team made further advancements in refining the project based on direct client feedback received during the Sprint 2. This sprint focused on two parallel fronts: UI/UX improvements for the website interface and enhancements to the AI chatbot system.

On the website side, the team conducted a comprehensive walkthrough of the current site and collected feedback from clients regarding navigation clarity and content structure. As a result, we started designing subpages (e.g., News, Canvas, Seminars) to support better content categorization and transitioned toward a more structured, top-level navigation layout. Feedback emphasized improving layout clarity and alignment with user expectations, which we incorporated into a wireframe for the upcoming sprint.

On the chatbot side, we demonstrated the initial Q&A functionality and reviewed suggestions from clients regarding tone, response quality, and interaction methods. The team began planning integration of user feedback mechanisms, such as shortcut buttons for Canvas and Wattle, and drafted a roadmap to improve the bot's natural language understanding and response tone.

### **What Challenges and How Did We Solve Them?**

- **Ambiguity in client expectations regarding chatbot tone and behavior:** Clients expressed a need for more natural and accurate chatbot interactions. We addressed this by analyzing example dialogues and drafting revised intent-response mappings for improved tone and accuracy.
- **Navigation redesign complexity:** Implementing subpage-level navigation while maintaining aesthetic simplicity proved difficult. Our UI team collaborated with clients to prioritize usability and reduce visual clutter, choosing minimalist layouts over dynamic distractions.
- **Feature coordination across teams:** Ensuring consistent progress across UI and chatbot sub-teams required closer coordination. Weekly standups and a shared task board improved synchronization.

### **Areas for Improvement and Reflection**

Looking back at Sprint 2, we identified several opportunities to enhance performance:

- **Earlier prototyping with stakeholders:** Sharing early-stage mockups could help surface navigation issues sooner and streamline iteration cycles.
- **Clearer documentation of client preferences:** While verbal feedback was helpful, documenting client suggestions in actionable formats (e.g., annotated screenshots or decision logs) would improve implementation precision.
- **Deeper integration planning:** As chatbot and UI features become more intertwined, joint testing and integration checkpoints will become increasingly important.

As we enter Sprint 3, the team will focus on:

- **Implementing navigation redesign and subpage creation**
- **Enhancing chatbot response quality and incorporating feedback features**
- **Conducting integrated testing of UI-chatbot interactions to ensure usability and coherence**
