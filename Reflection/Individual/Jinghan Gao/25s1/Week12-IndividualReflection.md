# Week 12 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week marked the final delivery phase of our project. I took the lead in organizing and updating all documentation on GitHub to ensure that everything was clearly structured and ready for handover. This included cleaning up outdated files, categorizing documents, and making sure instructions were clear and accessible.

I also completed the final version of the AI chatbot, trained it with the latest data, and successfully embedded it into the webpage, ensuring it functioned as expected in the deployed environment.

The final guide book was completed and delivered to the client, along with a Chatbase introduction document that explains how the chatbot platform works and how it can be maintained in the future.

Lastly, I carefully reviewed the project checklist and ensured that every item was delivered, confirming that our team had fulfilled all client requirements.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week was a strong conclusion to the project. I learned how to manage a complete software delivery, from final model deployment to thorough documentation and client communication. Organizing the GitHub repository improved my skills in project structuring and version control. Finalizing and integrating the chatbot gave me hands-on experience in end-to-end system deployment. Most importantly, successfully wrapping up the project taught me the value of meticulous attention to detail and professionalism in project closure. Iâ€™m proud to have completed and delivered a functional product that meets the client's expectations.
