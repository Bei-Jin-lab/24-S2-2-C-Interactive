# Week 9 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week marked the end of Sprint 2. We successfully completed the goals set in the previous week, focusing on improving the accuracy of the AI chatbotâ€™s responses. In particular, we addressed the client's requirement that if a user's question contains keywords present in the Q&A training data, the chatbot should prioritize answering using the Q&A responses.

Based on this, we upgraded the chatbot and completed the second version of the training model. We also ensured all related documentation was properly updated and finalized as part of our standard workflow.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week, I gained a deeper understanding of how to fine-tune chatbot behavior to meet specific client requirements. Training the second version of the AI chatbot helped me improve my skills in iterative model development and version control. I also learned the value of validating accuracy before deployment and ensuring that the system responds predictably and reliably. Routine documentation work further emphasized the importance of maintaining clear and traceable project records.
