# Week 6 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, my primary focus was on data cleaning. I began by reviewing all the collected guidebook links and extracting those that also exist on SharePoint, assigning them the highest priority.Next, I cleaned the remaining guidebook links by removing irrelevant content, such as video links. I then sorted the remaining links based on relevance â€” for example, links related to teaching content were given higher priority, while links about general Canvas introductions or policy information were placed lower in the order.I also manually reviewed all the downloaded SharePoint PDFs and assigned priorities to them, ensuring that the most important documents would be used first during AI chatbot training. After this, I compiled all the sorted files and links into a structured data collection manual to guide the next steps.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week, I learned the importance of data cleaning. Clean, organized, and prioritized data is essential for ensuring the chatbot learns from high-quality and relevant sources. This task not only improved my attention to detail but also gave me experience in aligning data processing with client goals. Looking forward, I hope to continue improving my skills in data preparation and contribute to refining the AI training process. I also realized the value of teamwork and clear documentation in collaborative data-related projects.
