# Week 7 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I focused on training the AI chatbot using the cleaned and prioritized data collected during Sprint 1. Based on our research from last semester, we chose to use Chatbase as the training platform. I uploaded 32 files, 228 links, and two fixed Q&A pairs to complete the initial model training.
In addition to training the model, I customized the appearance of the chatbot by adding a name, avatar, and adjusting the font color to make the interface more user-friendly. I also implemented two important constraints:
- The chatbot only accepts questions asked in English.
- It is restricted to answering questions related to Wattle and Canvas; unrelated questions will be declined.

Finally, I collaborated with the frontend team to successfully deploy the chatbot onto the website.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week, I learned how to train an AI chatbot using Chatbase and how to enforce content and language constraints to ensure the chatbot behaves as intended. I also gained valuable experience in customizing chatbot appearance and working with the frontend team to integrate the chatbot into the website. These tasks improved my technical skills and taught me the importance of collaboration, especially when aligning backend and frontend components in a project.
