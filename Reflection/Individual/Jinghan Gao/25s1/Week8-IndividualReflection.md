# Week 8 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, based on the client's request, I and Yujing wrote a guidebook to teach the client how to continue training the AI chatbot after project delivery. This ensures that the client can independently update the chatbot in the future. I also continued maintaining our documentation.

Additionally, our team held a meeting to discuss how to update the chatbot to better meet client requirements. Specifically, we planned a new training approach in which the chatbot prioritizes using the Q&A pairs if keywords in a user's question match those in the training set.

Meanwhile, the frontend team members made updates to the website based on the client's feedback, improving both usability and design according to their specifications.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week, I learned that project delivery is not the end of the process. It is equally important to support the client in maintaining and updating the product in the future. Writing the guidebook helped me practice clear, user-oriented documentation. I also gained insights into how to refine chatbot training strategies and the importance of internal team discussions in aligning technical solutions with client expectations.
