# Week 10 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week marked the beginning of Sprint 3. Our team focused on planning and coordination to ensure a smooth final phase of the project. We drafted a detailed delivery plan for the client and sought confirmation to make sure the timeline and deliverables aligned with their expectations.

In response to the feedback received during Sprint 2, we also made targeted modifications to the AI chatbot to improve its performance and usability. Meanwhile, our team completed the the project poster and pitch presentation, consolidating our progress and communicating our goals effectively.

Another key milestone this week was the successful delivery of the first version of the webpage to the client, marking an important step in integrating our work into the clientâ€™s environment.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week, I learned how to manage communication more effectively with clients by using delivery plans to ensure mutual understanding. The feedback loop from Sprint 2 taught me how to iteratively improve the chatbot based on real user needs. I also enhanced my skills in collaborative content creation through the development of the poster and pitch materials. Delivering the first version of the webpage gave me a clearer sense of how different parts of the project come together for deployment and client handoff.
