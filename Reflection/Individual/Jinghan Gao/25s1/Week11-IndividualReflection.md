# Week 11 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, we received an important piece of feedback from the client that highlighted a critical risk in our project. We had mistakenly included the admin username and password in the guide book, which was then uploaded to a public GitHub repository. This posed a serious security issue, as anyone could potentially use the credentials to access the admin account.

Upon realizing this, we acted quickly to mitigate the risk. We immediately removed the guide book from GitHub and securely shared it with the client via Microsoft Teams. Additionally, we updated the guide book and rewrote it in a more detailed and user-friendly manner.

Following another suggestion from the client, we also improved the AI chatbotâ€™s responses by adding a support email address at the end of each reply. This provides users with a clear channel to seek further help if needed.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week taught me the importance of security awareness and responsible documentation in software projects. The incident with the credentials reminded me that even small oversights can lead to significant vulnerabilities. I also learned how to respond swiftly and professionally to potential risks. Additionally, implementing the support email feature enhanced my understanding of user-centric design and the importance of providing clear follow-up channels for unresolved queries. Finally, refining the guide book improved my technical writing skills and emphasized the value of thorough, secure, and accessible documentation.
