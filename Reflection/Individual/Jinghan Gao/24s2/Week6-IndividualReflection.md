# Week 6 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, my main focus was on preparing for Audit 2 and managing various logs that track the project’s progress. I worked on completing and organizing several logs, including the meeting log, decision log, feedback log, and task log. I carefully reviewed feedback from meetings, identified feedback that aligned with our project’s goals, and incorporated these into our decision-making process. Once decisions were made, I updated the task log accordingly to ensure that all actions were clearly documented. Additionally, I revised the Statement of Work (Sow), particularly the sections related to the AI component. Another significant task was creating the presentation slides and delivering the presentation.

The primary challenge this week was efficiently managing and organizing the large volume of feedback and decisions from various meetings. It was time-consuming to cross-check each piece of feedback and ensure that all logs were updated consistently. I addressed this challenge by setting up a systematic approach to track decisions and task assignments, which streamlined the process and made it easier to maintain accurate records.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week’s work taught me the importance of meticulous documentation and the critical role that logs play in project management. Maintaining well-organized logs not only helps track the project’s progress but also provides a clear reference for decision-making. I also learned how essential it is to align team decisions with client feedback, as this ensures that our work stays relevant and meets stakeholders’ expectations. Moving forward, I plan to maintain a proactive approach to documentation, ensuring that all feedback is systematically captured and utilized in our decision-making processes.
