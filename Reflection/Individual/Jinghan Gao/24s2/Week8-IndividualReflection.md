# Week 8 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I focused on comparing different AI chatbot technologies and created a detailed comparison table outlining the strengths and weaknesses of each option. This table will be used in our upcoming client meeting to help decide which technology to adopt for our project.
Each technology has its own advantages and limitations. One of the key concerns raised by the client was whether using GPT models would result in continuous training during user interactions, potentially leading to incorrect outcomes. To address this concern, I researched that GPT models operate is in an inference mode, not in a training mode. This means that during user interactions, the model does not learn or adjust based on the input; it only responds based on its pre-trained data. 

Additionally, Yunru and I  reached out to the ANU IT department to discuss the issue of whitelisting the chatbot, ensuring that our chosen solution complies with ANU's IT policies.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week’s experience highlighted the importance of a thorough evaluation process when selecting technologies, as each option presents unique challenges. Engaging with the ANU IT department provided valuable insights into compliance requirements, which are crucial for the chatbot’s implementation within university systems.

Moving forward, I will continue refining our approach based on client feedback and IT guidelines to ensure a smooth integration of the selected AI technology that meets project needs.
