# Week 5 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
In week 5, I took the lead in organizing a brainstorming session during our team meeting, using the  features list summarized by Yujing Zhang. We identified the two highest-priority features and broke them down into 24 tasks, prioritizing the top 7 tasks that need immediate development. I also continued handling all meeting minutes (for the client, tutor, and team meetings) and revised the AI-related sections in the new version of the SOW. Based on the tutorâ€™s feedback during the meeting, added a feedback log and consolidated all past feedback from various meetings into this new log, along with updates to the decision log.

During our client meeting, I recognized the crucial importance of consistently maintaining and updating all logs, which has become a key focus in our process. In our team meeting, I organized the task assignments and reminded everyone of key considerations based on the tutor's feedback. Additionally, I reviewed all content on Ed and Wattle to ensure the team stays on track and completes tasks on time.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week highlighted the importance of structured task management and log maintenance. By prioritizing and organizing tasks based on our brainstorming session, we have a clearer direction for development. The process of maintaining detailed logs, especially incorporating feedback and decisions into dedicated logs, proved invaluable in keeping the project aligned with both client and team expectations. Additionally, this week reinforced the importance of keeping the team informed and on schedule, which I achieved by regularly checking resources like Ed and Wattle. Next step, I aim to further refine our task tracking and continue emphasizing the importance of thorough and timely documentation across all aspects of the project.
