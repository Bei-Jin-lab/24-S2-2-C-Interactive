# Week 3 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I communicated with stakeholders (the client) regarding the approach to implementing the AI chatbot in our project. I proposed using a self-trained AI chatbot model as the core solution. However, the client raised concerns regarding this approach: The accuracy of self-trained models might not be as high as that of existing large models. Conversely, using a large model might make it difficult to provide ANU-specific policy-related answers. To address these concerns, I engaged in further discussions with the client, during which they suggested the possibility of leveraging an existing large model with additional training to meet our needs. The primary challenge was reconciling these technical considerations with the project’s requirements. 


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This experience taught me the importance of evaluating both the strengths and limitations of technical solutions from different perspectives. Initially, I focused on the flexibility of self-trained models, but after hearing the client’s concerns, I realized that a more balanced approach was necessary. I also learned the value of early and open communication with stakeholders—by listening to the client’s feedback.  Moving forward, I plan to involve key stakeholders earlier in the decision-making process to ensure that all potential benefits are thoroughly concerned.
