# Week 7 IndividualReflection 
**Name**:  Jinghan Gao

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I focused on finding a suitable AI chatbot solution for our project. After exploring various options, I discovered that the Chatbase platform used by the CASS college aligns well with our project requirements. I downloaded ANU policy-related content and collected additional data from the client-provided website to use for training the chatbot. I experimented with training the free version of the AI chatbot and tested its performance with my team to see if it could be integrated into our developing website.

The main challenge was navigating the limitations of the free version of Chatbase, which restricted some functionalities needed for a more comprehensive training of the chatbot. Need to request funding from client for paid version.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
This week’s experience reinforced the importance of resourcefulness when dealing with budget constraints and limited access to full-featured tools. I learned how to effectively utilize the free version of an AI chatbot platform to build a basic model that meets initial project needs, which was essential in demonstrating the feasibility of this approach to the team. Additionally, working with the collected data provided valuable insights into how well the chatbot could handle ANU-specific queries, highlighting areas for further training and improvement.

Moving forward, my next step is to request funding from the client to access more advanced training capabilities for the chatbot. This will enable us to refine its performance and ensure it meets the project’s goals more effectively.
