*  100-200 words
* Can use bullet points or write a summary (answer belows question)

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- My partner and I utilized waffle.io in the weathrly project, starting by making several issues that we anticipated early in the project.
- It was challenging to keep up with using waffle.io because we did most of the work sitting next to each other. We resolved this by directly communicating about what we were doing and planning for the next steps without heavily relying on the tool.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- I learned that while tools like waffle.io might not be as necessary when working in close proximity, they are crucial for managing work when team members are not physically together.
