### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- Present the outcome to the clients
- analysis the needs of clients
- Update the tasklog based on client's needs
- Assist in AI training
  
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- Presenting our outcomes to clients pushed me outside my comfort zone, but seeing their positive reactions to our visualization approach was truly rewarding. The needs analysis challenged me to listen more deeplyâ€”I found myself picking up on subtle cues I would have missed before, especially when clients expressed concerns about the AI integration timeline.
- Updating the task log initially felt overwhelming with so many competing priorities, but I developed a new color-coding system that helped me track urgent vs. important tasks more effectively.
- The most exciting part was definitely assisting with AI training; diving into prompt engineering was totally new territory for me, and I struggled at first with crafting effective prompts. After several iterations and testing different approaches, I discovered a framework that significantly improved our model's response accuracy.
