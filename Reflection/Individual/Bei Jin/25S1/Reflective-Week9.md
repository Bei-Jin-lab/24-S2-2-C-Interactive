### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- Update members' meeting 
- Asist improve AI part 
  
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- Through this week's tasks, I developed a deeper understanding of how scenario design connects with user experience. Updating the scenario documents required careful consideration of stakeholder feedback, which initially presented challenges in balancing competing priorities.
- By creating a structured framework to categorize and address these concerns, I was able to make more informed decisions about which elements to modify. Working on persona development improved my ability to translate abstract user needs into concrete characteristics that guide our design process.
- The most significant growth came while assisting with AI improvements, where I gained practical knowledge about prompt engineering and response optimization techniques. This experience enhanced my technical vocabulary and analytical skills when evaluating AI performance. Overall, these tasks strengthened my capacity to maintain cohesion between business requirements and technical implementation while improving my documentation skills to ensure clarity across team communications.
