### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- Update Scenario
- Update Feedback log based on the Client Meeting
- Assist in data cleaning
  
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

-  Updating the scenario and feedback log pushed me to sharpen my documentation skills, as I found myself carefully capturing nuances from our client meeting that I might have overlooked before.
-  The data cleaning process was particularly challengingâ€”I encountered several inconsistent formats that initially had me scratching my head, but through persistent problem-solving and a bit of creative thinking, I managed to develop a systematic approach that saved us hours of manual work.
-  What surprised me most was how my confidence in client interactions has grown; I found myself not just passively taking notes but actively engaging with their feedback and suggesting improvements they hadn't considered.
