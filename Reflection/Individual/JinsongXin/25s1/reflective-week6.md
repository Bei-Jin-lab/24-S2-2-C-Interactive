# Week6 Individual Reflection  
**Name:**  Jinsong Xin

## 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?  
This week, we had a feedback meeting with our client. The client pointed out that the vertical sidebar navigation in version 1.1 was not user-friendly and suggested changing it to a horizontal top navigation bar. They also requested adjustments to colors, fonts, and layout. Based on the feedback, I worked on updating the website to version 1.2, which included adding a top navigation bar and two scroll-following floating buttons (sidebar navigation and chatbot shortcut). I also removed excessive animations to focus more on content presentation.  

The main challenges were implementing font switching, which required external resources, and applying the top navigation bar globally. These were resolved through documentation research and continuous debugging.

## 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  
I learned how to quickly adapt the website's structure and style based on client feedback, improving its usability and user experience. By referencing the official ANU website and collaborating with my teammate Yujing Zhang, I also enhanced my ability to maintain visual consistency in web design. Additionally, I became more skilled in HTML and CSS layout and styling techniques.
