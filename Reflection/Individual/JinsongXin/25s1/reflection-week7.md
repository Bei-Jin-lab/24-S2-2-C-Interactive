## Week 7 Individual Reflection  
**Name:**  Jinsong Xin

- This week marked the final client review after the midterm break. As a developer and maintainer on the web front end, I contributed to several key tasks:
  - Assisted Yiou Liu with the integration of the posting feature.
  - Helped Jinhan Gao embed the latest version of the chatbot.
  - Supported Yunrun Chen with the integration of the survey.
  - Made UI and layout adjustments to the website to ensure a complete transition from version 1.2 to version 1.3.

### Reflection:

- This week highlighted the complexity of team collaboration and module integration. Supporting multiple teammates simultaneously required clear communication and careful version control. I also improved my debugging skills, especially for embedding components like surveys and chatbots, and gained a deeper understanding of layout design and user experience on the web.
