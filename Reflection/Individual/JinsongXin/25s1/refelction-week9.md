## Week 9 Individual Reflection  
**Name:** Jinsong Xin

- This week, I successfully implemented the categorized display of articles using two different methods:
  - **Method 1:** Creating separate websites linked to specific tags. This approach allows for a high degree of customization and functionality but requires a new webpage for each category, making long-term maintenance more difficult.
  - **Method 2:** Utilizing WordPress’s built-in tagging system to automatically generate pages that display content under each tag. While this method is limited in customization, it is maintenance-free and efficient.

### Reflection:

- I gained valuable insights into balancing customization and maintainability in web development. Comparing the two methods helped me understand the trade-offs between manual control and automation. I also deepened my knowledge of WordPress’s tag system and how to leverage built-in features for scalable content management.
