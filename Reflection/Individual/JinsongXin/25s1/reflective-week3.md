**Week3 Individual Reflection**  
**Name:**

**1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?**  
- This week, we re-established contact with the client and held a meeting to understand the work required for the new semester.  
- We discussed the client’s updated needs and clarified the direction for future updates to the website design.  
- One of the challenges was ensuring we fully understood the client’s expectations and priorities. To address this, we prepared specific questions in advance and took detailed notes during the meeting to avoid any misunderstandings.

**2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?**  
- I learned the importance of clear and proactive communication with clients, especially when project goals evolve over time.  
- This experience helped me improve my ability to gather requirements and translate client feedback into actionable plans for future website development.
