## Week 12 Individual Reflection

**Name: Jinsong Xin**

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

* This week, I completed the user manual for the website, which includes detailed instructions on how to use and manage the site, as well as how to make future content updates or modifications.
* I ensured that the manual is clear, beginner-friendly, and easy for both technical and non-technical users to follow.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

* I gained experience in documenting technical processes clearly and systematically.
* Writing the manual helped me better understand the importance of maintainability and knowledge transfer in real-world projects.
* It also trained my ability to consider the userâ€™s perspective when explaining functions and instructions.
