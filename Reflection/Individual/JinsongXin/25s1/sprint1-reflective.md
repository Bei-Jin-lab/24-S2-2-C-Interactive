# Sprint 1 Individual Reflection (Week 3 - Week 6)  
**Name:**  Jinsong Xin

## 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?  
- In Week 3, we re-established communication with the client and held our first meeting of the semester to understand their updated requirements. We clarified the direction for future website development. To ensure alignment, we prepared specific questions in advance and took detailed notes during the meeting.  
- In Week 4 and week 5, I discussed with Henry, who provided a template website for reference. Based on that, I redesigned the site layout and developed version 1.1 of the website. I retained some animations and added features such as a chatbot shortcut button, a vertical sidebar navigation, and a light/dark mode toggle.  
- In Week 5 and week 6, we had an in-person meeting to present version 1.1 to Henry. He found the sidebar navigation less practical and felt the site focused too much on animations instead of content. He also suggested improvements in color scheme, font, and layout. Based on this feedback, I began working on version 1.2 of the website.

## 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  
Through ongoing client communication and iterative development, I improved my ability to design structured and user-friendly interfaces. I also learned how to respond efficiently to client feedback and collaborate more effectively with my team. This experience enhanced my understanding of visual consistency and code maintainability in web development.

## 3. Future Plans  
Moving forward, I will continue refining the website to better match the clientâ€™s expectations. Before Sprint 2, I aim to resolve remaining issues in version 1.2, such as the limitations of the posting feature, and further improve the overall user experience.
