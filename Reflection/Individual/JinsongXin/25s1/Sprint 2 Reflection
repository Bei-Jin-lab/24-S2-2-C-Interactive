## Sprint 2 Individual Reflection  
**Name:** Jinsong Xin

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- Sprint 2 began after the midterm break, and we first conducted a final review session with the client. I collaborated with the team to integrate and optimize several frontend features, including assisting with the posting function, embedding the chatbot and the questionnaire, and fine-tuning the UI and layout to complete the transition from version 1.2 to 1.3.
- Based on client feedback, I participated in the design of version 1.4, focusing on developing a content categorization and display system. The goal was to display different types of articles on different pages.
- During development, I experimented with two technical approaches: the first involved creating a separate page for each category and linking them via tags, which allowed rich customization but had higher maintenance costs; the second used WordPress’s built-in tag system to automatically generate content pages, which required minimal maintenance but lacked flexibility.
- Additionally, a new bug appeared in the posting function, which required debugging and fixing.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- This phase deepened my understanding of the complexity of frontend content management, particularly the balance between user experience and maintainability. I learned how to design scalable structures and enhanced my knowledge of WordPress’s internal logic through evaluating different solutions.
- I also improved my ability to handle integration issues and UI optimization in a multi-tasking team environment.

### 3. Future Plans

- Moving forward, I will continue refining version 1.4, addressing edge cases in content categorization. In the next sprint, I aim to focus on improving the stability of the posting function and further enhancing the quality and usability of content presentation on the website.
