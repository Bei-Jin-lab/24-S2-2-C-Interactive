**Week5 Individual Reflection**  
**Name:**

**1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?**  
- This week, I updated and redesigned the content of the WordPress homepage.  
- I added a hidden menu button and a chatbot button, making it easier for users to interact with the webpage.  
- The main challenge was how to maintain visual appeal while enhancing the practicality of the page. To solve this, I simplified the structure and shifted the focus from visual effects to content, allowing users to concentrate more on the information rather than being distracted by animations.

**2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?**  
- I realized that in web design, user experience should be the top priority. Clear content presentation is often more important than fancy effects when it comes to usability.  
- At the same time, I improved my understanding of WordPress page structure and interaction features, and learned how small feature additions can significantly enhance the overall user experience.
