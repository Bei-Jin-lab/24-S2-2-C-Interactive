## Week 8 Individual Reflection  
**Name:**

- This week, I focused on collecting and analyzing feedback from the final client review. Based on the feedback, I participated in designing the iteration plan for version 1.4 of the website.
  - The main goal was to improve content layout by implementing a system for categorizing articles.
  - I started planning how to ensure that articles of different categories can be displayed on separate pages.
  - Additionally, we discovered a new bug in the posting feature, which required further debugging and testing.

### Reflection:

- I learned how to transform client feedback into actionable technical improvements. Designing the content categorization system helped me think more deeply about front-end structure and user navigation. Debugging the posting issue also reinforced my problem-solving skills and reminded me of the importance of thorough testing after new feature integration.
