## Sprint 3 Individual Reflection

**Name: Jinsong Xin**

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

* During Sprint 3, I focused on finalizing website features and preparing for project delivery.
* In Week 10, I had a brainstorming session with the team’s AI lead to align integration strategies and participated in client meetings to finalize delivery expectations. I also contributed to drafting the team’s final delivery plan.
* In Week 11, I addressed several technical issues on the front end, including fixing the homepage centering issue, creating a collapsible sidebar menu, improving mobile responsiveness, and implementing dynamic links for the site logo.
* In Week 12, I independently completed the website’s user manual, providing clear instructions on how to use, manage, and update the website. This documentation supports future handovers and maintenance.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

* I improved my skills in debugging, responsive design, and interactive layout development.
* Collaborating with teammates and preparing documentation strengthened my ability to communicate clearly across roles and document technical work systematically.
* Writing the user manual also made me more aware of the importance of maintainability and usability from a user’s perspective.

### 3. Future Plans

* In the next phase, I will assist the team with final delivery, ensure the site runs smoothly, and make final adjustments based on client feedback to ensure a complete and polished handover.
