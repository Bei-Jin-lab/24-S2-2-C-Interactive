# Week 3 Individual Reflection
# Name: Jinsong Xin

# Tasks and Challenges: 
During this week, my main responsibility was selecting the frontend tools. I compared the pros and cons of traditional coding methods, building sites with GitHub, and using WordPress. By analyzing stakeholder needs and evaluating these options from multiple dimensions, I ultimately chose the most suitable frontend tool for our project. Additionally, I used WordPress to create the project’s landing page, consolidating project information on the site. I also wrote the reflection report for the group’s second week and the risk management document.  
The challenge was selecting the right frontend tool, as it required balancing usability, efficiency, and future maintenance costs. Through detailed analysis and comparison, I overcame this challenge and ensured we chose the optimal solution.

# Reflection and Learning:
I learned that using WordPress to build a website is a very effective option. It’s not only simple to operate and easy to manage but also convenient for future maintenance. Additionally, I realized the importance of early tool selection in the project, which helps ensure the smooth progression of subsequent work.
