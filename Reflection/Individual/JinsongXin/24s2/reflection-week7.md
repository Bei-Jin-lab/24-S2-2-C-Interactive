## Week 7 Individual Reflection

**1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?**

- During Week 7, I focused on completing several key interfaces for our SharePoint demo, including the publishing interface, the modification interface, and the chatbox interface.
- In addition to this, I spent time exploring the internal functionalities of SharePoint to better understand its capabilities and limitations.
- One of the major challenges I encountered was realizing that the online version of SharePoint is significantly limited in terms of customization and functionality. To create a truly user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface, we would need to use local deployment and custom components, which provide more control but introduce additional complexity.
- A key obstacle was the lack of available resources online. The information related to building custom solutions for SharePoint is scarce, and this made it difficult to find guidance or examples to follow. Starting from scratch in this environment required a lot of trial and error, and progress was slower than expected due to this resource gap.

**2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?**

- This week, I deepened my understanding of SharePointâ€™s architecture, particularly in terms of its limitations when used purely online. I learned that while SharePoint can handle basic tasks through its online functionality, more advanced and visually appealing interfaces require a local deployment setup with custom components. This insight will shape how we approach future development work.
- I also gained valuable problem-solving experience. The scarcity of online resources forced me to think creatively and explore alternative ways to achieve our project goals. This challenge highlighted the importance of resourcefulness in development work and has pushed me to improve my research skills when dealing with unfamiliar technology.
- Moving forward, I plan to explore new avenues for finding relevant resources, such as reaching out to SharePoint communities, joining developer forums, or experimenting with different tools to overcome the challenges we are facing. I have learned that being proactive in seeking solutions, even when conventional resources are lacking, is essential for progressing in such complex environments.
