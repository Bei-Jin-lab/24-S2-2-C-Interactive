## Week 6 Individual Reflection

**1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?**

- During Week 6, our team conducted a review of the audlt2 project.
- I completed and refined some documentation and made modifications to the landing page by adding prototype and UML diagram displays.
- The challenge was deploying the React framework, which I resolved by finding resources online.

**2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?**

- From the feedback received during the presentation, I realized our initial development approach needed to change due to insufficient research on alternative tools.
- We initially considered using other platforms, but I lacked the confidence to move forward due to inadequate understanding.
- We decided to switch to SharePoint as the primary platform to meet our project's security requirements.
- Moving forward, I will ensure more thorough research to avoid similar challenges and make better decisions.
