## Week 8 Individual Reflection

**1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?**

- Based on feedback and group brainstorming, we decided to create three different demos using three different technologies to compare their pros and cons.
- I completed the WordPress demo as part of this plan, spending around 5 hours to create it.
- During the process, I encountered challenges with some WordPress components, which were difficult to use. I had to experiment and research how to implement them properly to ensure the demo was functional.

**2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?**

- I learned that while WordPress can be an accessible platform for quick demo creation, certain components can be tricky to configure, especially for customized use cases.
- This process helped me improve my ability to troubleshoot and experiment with different features, which will be useful in deciding which technology is best suited for our final implementation.
- Moving forward, I will continue to explore the other two technologies to complete the comparative analysis and ensure we make an informed decision based on the strengths and weaknesses of each option.
