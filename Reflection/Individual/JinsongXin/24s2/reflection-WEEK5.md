# Week 5 Individual Reflection
# Name: Jinsong Xin
# Tasks and Challenges:
During the fifth week, I made significant updates and changes to the landing page, simplifying the layout and adding new features. Additionally, I completed my weekly individual reflections and began learning the React framework.  
However, I encountered considerable difficulties while optimizing the details of the landing page. Some simple positioning tasks were challenging to implement in WordPress, which made the process of rebuilding the landing page quite difficult.

# Reflection and Learning:
While analyzing the WordPress code, I realized that future maintenance and modifications would be very challenging, so I decided to abandon WordPress as the frontend development tool entirely. I also learned about agile development principles and how task segmentation in frontend development can greatly improve efficiency. Although this week’s optimization of the landing page was substantial, it’s not finished, and further iterations and updates will be necessary.
