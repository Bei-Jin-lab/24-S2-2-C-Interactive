# Week 4 Individual Reflection
# Name: Jinosng Xin

# Tasks and Challenges:
During the fourth week, I updated the tool selection report from the third week by adding an analysis of SharePoint. After comparing SharePoint, WordPress, GitHub, and traditional methods, and considering the needs of stakeholders and the difficulty of project implementation, we ultimately decided to stick with WordPress as the frontend tool for the project. Additionally, I maintained the landing page and added new sections, such as detailed log entries.
I also created several project prototypes, including the user settings page, post creation page, historical posts view page, chatbox page, post template page, system log page (for administrators to view all user activities), and the draft box page. During the prototype design process, there were multiple discussions among frontend developers regarding the number of web pages and content distribution, which were eventually resolved. The comparison between SharePoint and WordPress was particularly challenging, as both had their strengths and weaknesses, but we ultimately chose WordPress due to its aesthetic advantages.

# Reflection and Learning:
I found that WordPress is more comprehensive than I initially thought, but certain personalized features are still somewhat rough. This week, we finalized the total number of pages and completed the overall project modeling.
