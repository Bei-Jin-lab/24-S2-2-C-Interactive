# Week 5 Individual Reflection 
**Name**:  Yunru Chen



### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- Continued my responsibility of composing the weekly group reflection, summarizing our project’s progress and key learning points.
- Created UML diagrams to provide a clear structural and behavioral view of our application.
- Actively engaged in updating our risk log, with a particular focus on potential backend-related issues. This involved anticipating possible challenges and proposing mitigation strategies to preemptively address them.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- Developing UML diagrams enhanced my technical design skills and deepened my understanding of how different components of our system interact.
- The process of updating the risk log, especially for backend risks, honed my ability to identify and strategize against potential project risks. It was an exercise in critical thinking and proactive problem-solving.
- Writing the group reflection regularly has improved my reflective writing skills and my ability to see the bigger picture in our project’s journey.
