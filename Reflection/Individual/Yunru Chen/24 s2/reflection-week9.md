### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

This week, I undertook the responsibility of creating a poster to effectively showcase our project. Initially, my concept of a poster was influenced by movie posters, which typically focus on eye-catching visuals and succinct text. However, my perspective shifted significantly after reviewing examples of academic posters in the CSIT building.

The primary challenge was transitioning from the idea of a visually driven poster to one rich in content and suitable for an academic setting. To address this, I studied several outstanding posters, noting how they balanced aesthetics with informative content.

Determining what content to include was another hurdle. The poster needed to convey the projectâ€™s background, objectives, current achievements, and future plans concisely. I solved this by structuring the content into clearly defined sections, which helped in presenting a coherent narrative.

Integrating visuals and text to create an engaging yet informative poster required careful planning. I opted for a clean layout with compelling graphics that complemented the text, ensuring that the visuals enhanced the information rather than overwhelmed it.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

This task was immensely educational, providing me with insights into effective communication through visual media. By experimenting with different layouts and visual elements, I improved my design skills, particularly in creating academic posters that require a balance of aesthetic appeal and information density. Reflecting on this experience, I appreciate the importance of clarity and organization in presenting complex information. This skill is not only valuable in academic settings but is also applicable in professional environments where clear communication is key to success.
