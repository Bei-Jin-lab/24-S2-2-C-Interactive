# Week 5 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

This week, I was primarily involved in supporting the chatbot training team. My main responsibility was to verify the datasets collected by my teammates, ensuring there were no missing or irrelevant entries. This required carefully cross-checking sources and maintaining consistency across the dataset. One of the challenges I faced was identifying subtle overlaps and omissions in the collected data. To address this, I developed a simple validation checklist and communicated closely with team members to clarify the intended data structure and content range.

In addition to my technical role, I also contributed to team coordination and documentation. Specifically, I created the peer review questionnaire template to facilitate our Sprint 1 team evaluation and drafted the Sprint 1 group reflection based on inputs from both sub-groups. As usual, I was also responsible for completing the tutorial meeting minutes for Week 5, ensuring all discussions and decisions were clearly recorded.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

Through my involvement in both technical validation and team coordination, I gained a deeper understanding of the importance of data quality in AI training and the role of internal documentation in agile teamwork. This week enhanced my attention to detail, particularly in verifying large datasets, and strengthened my communication skills when working across sub-teams. I also learned how reflective tools like peer reviews and group reflections can provide valuable insights for process improvement, which will benefit us in the upcoming sprint phases.
