# Week 10 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

In Week 10, my primary task was to update and supplement various project logs to ensure consistent documentation. I continued to attend both the client meeting and the tutorial meeting as usual, maintaining the weekly tutorial meeting minutes and completing my individual reflections as part of the regular workflow.

Based on the feedback received during the client meeting, I also contributed to preparing the updated delivery plan. This plan helped clarify the direction of our upcoming work and ensured that our deliverables would align with client expectations. One of the challenges this week was synthesizing feedback into actionable steps within the plan; I addressed this by carefully reviewing the clientâ€™s comments and collaborating with teammates to align our goals and timelines accordingly.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

This week reinforced the importance of consistent documentation and communication in team-based projects. Maintaining the logs and meeting records allowed me to better track progress and ensure accountability. Additionally, transforming client feedback into a concrete delivery plan helped me improve my ability to interpret stakeholder input and translate it into clear, structured actions. I became more confident in balancing administrative responsibilities with strategic planning tasks.
