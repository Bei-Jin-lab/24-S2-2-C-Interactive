# Week 6 Individual Reflection

#### **1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?**

During week 6, my main focus was on collaborative validation of the previously collected search data. We cross-checked the dataset with other team members to ensure its completeness and consistency. This task included identifying potentially redundant data and correcting discrepancies in the data entries. During the verification process, I discovered that certain members had missed some data collections and helped to fill them in.
In addition to technical support, I was actively involved in Sprint 1 audit preparation. Specifically, I participated in discussions of relevant scenarios and user stories during team meetings to help solidify our shared understanding of the goals of this phase of the project. I also created peer review form templates for our team evaluations and completed evaluations for each member based on our recent collaboration. These efforts supported the overall coordination of our sprint retrospective and ensured that the reflection process was fair and organized.

#### **2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?**

This week deepened my understanding of collaborative quality assurance, especially in terms of how collective data validation can improve reliability for downstream development tasks. I improved my ability to communicate constructively when reviewing othersâ€™ work. The experience of engaging in scenario and user story discussions also helped me better connect technical implementation with user-oriented goals. Overall, Week 6 strengthened both my technical attention to detail and my collaborative contribution to agile project cycle.
