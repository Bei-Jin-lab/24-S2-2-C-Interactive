# Week 7 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

In Week 7, my primary contribution was supporting the website development subgroup, specifically by designing and completing the client feedback form. To prepare for this task, I first took the initiative to self-learn how to use Microsoft Forms effectively. This involved exploring its interface, understanding various question types, and experimenting with formatting options to ensure the form was both user-friendly and structurally sound.

Designing the feedback questions themselves proved to be the most time-consuming aspect. It required careful consideration to ensure that the questions would elicit meaningful and constructive responses from clients. I had to strike a balance between being comprehensive and concise. To address this challenge, I referred to our previous meeting notes and team discussions to frame relevant and targeted questions. I also consulted with subgroup members to confirm the clarity and relevance of each item before finalizing the form.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

This week allowed me to strengthen my initiative and self-learning abilities, particularly through independently mastering a new tool for form creation. I also developed a better understanding of user-centered design principles, recognizing how thoughtfully crafted questions can influence the quality of feedback received. Through collaboration with the website team and consultation with peers, I further improved my communication and teamwork skills. This experience will be especially useful in future tasks that involve client interaction and user experience design.
