# Week 10 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

In Week 11, the team focused on preparing the final deliverables, including the presentation poster and the guide book. I worked closely with team members to complete the poster design, ensuring that the layout was visually clear and aligned with our product identity.

To complement the visuals, I provided supplementary content explanations, such as descriptions of our web product’s features, to help clarify how the interface supports user needs and aligns with the project objectives. One of the main challenges was achieving a balance between aesthetics and clarity—some early poster drafts were visually attractive but lacked visual harmony. I helped revise the layout to ensure that our message was communicated more effectively.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

This week allowed me to strengthen my visual communication and collaboration skills. By working on the design and content of the final materials, I gained a better understanding of how to align visual and textual elements to create a cohesive and user-friendly presentation. The process also enhanced my ability to critically assess and refine design work, ensuring both clarity and professionalism in our final output.
