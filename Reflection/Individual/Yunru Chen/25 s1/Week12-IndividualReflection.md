# Week12 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

In Week 12, which aligned with our final Sprint 3, I took responsibility for coordinating and documenting key collaborative processes. This included recording our tutorial meeting discussions, drafting the group reflection, and preparing the peer review template for the team. These tasks ensured that our team maintained a clear and accurate record of progress and feedback, which was essential for aligning with both client expectations and course requirements.

Additionally, I contributed to the final poster design, working with teammates to organize content and improve visual presentation. I helped ensure the poster effectively conveyed the purpose and functionality of our web product while maintaining visual clarity and consistency with our project identity.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

This week improved my documentation and reflective writing skills, as I translated verbal feedback and group discussions into clear, structured text. I also gained experience in peer coordination, especially in preparing templates that support fair and structured peer review.

By participating in the final poster development, I enhanced my visual organization and cross-team communication abilitiesâ€”learning how to bridge design and content for effective public presentation. Overall, the sprint helped reinforce the importance of documentation, user-centric communication, and attention to detail in team-based projects.
