# Week 4 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

This week, I actively participated in our team's client meeting and tutorial session. My main responsibility involved collecting data to train our AI chatbot. As this was my first experience with AI chatbot training, I encountered challenges in understanding the process. Through team discussions and independent research, I clarified the essential training steps: data collection, data cleaning, and AI training. My current task in Sprint 1 focuses on extensive data collection, aiming to gather as much relevant information as possible while leaving considerations of data cleaning and deduplication for later phases.



### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

In this week, I learned the sequential nature of chatbot developmentâ€”data collection, data cleaning, and training. Furthermore, I realized the significance of comprehensive initial data collection, emphasizing quantity and relevance. This understanding has significantly improved my analytical thinking and preparation skills, laying a solid foundation for subsequent stages of the project.
