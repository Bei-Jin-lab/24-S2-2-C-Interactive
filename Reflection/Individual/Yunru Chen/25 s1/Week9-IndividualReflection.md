# Week 9 Individual Reflection

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

Week 9 was the review and acceptance phase of Sprint 2. My main focus this week was to actively work with the team to complete the Sprint 2 evaluation. I attended team meetings where we discussed how to build and refine the user stories and scenarios developed during the sprint. These discussions helped to ensure that our work meets the client's expectations and address the feedback from the last client meeting.

As in previous sprints, I continued to be responsible for drafting the Sprint 2 Team Reflections, synthesizing input from different subgroups to ensure a clear summary of progress, challenges, and next steps. In addition, I completed the minutes of the steering meeting, documenting key decisions and action items to keep the team on the same page. A minor challenge I encountered was ensuring that all discussion points were accurately recorded in real time; to overcome this I recorded each meeting, double checking any unclear sections.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

This week reinforced the importance of clear communication and structured documentation during sprint transitions. I gained more experience in analyzing and articulating progress through sprint reflections, which helped me improve my summarization and writing skills. Participating in user story and scenario design discussions also enhanced my understanding of requirement analysis and how detailed planning can guide development efforts. Overall, this week strengthened my role as both a contributor and facilitator within the teamâ€™s agile workflow.
