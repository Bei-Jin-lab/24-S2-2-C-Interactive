### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- This week, I focused on redesigning the SharePoint page. I changed the logo, theme, layout, and banner to improve the overall look and feel of the site. During the process, I learned how to customize these elements while editing the components.
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- I gained hands-on experience in modifying SharePoint’s visual elements, which enhanced my understanding of SharePoint’s customization capabilities. It also gave me more confidence in experimenting with different design options to create a more visually appealing layout.
- Additionally, I became more familiar with some limitations of SharePoint during the customization process, such as limitation in sharing,contents are only shared in the same organization and need to stay in login to see the contents. From these limitations, I learned the importance of considering platform constraints when planning a project. This experience taught me to anticipate these kinds of restrictions early in the design phase and to communicate them clearly to stakeholders. By doing so, I can avoid potential issues later in development and ensure the platform’s limitations are well understood before implementation begins.
