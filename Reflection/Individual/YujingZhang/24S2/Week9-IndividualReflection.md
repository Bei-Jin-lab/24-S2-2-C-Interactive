### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- This week, I filled in the details for the content pages in SharePoint version,and aligned the contents with the existing WordPress version. I successfully completed 6 additional pages, now there are total 7pages. However, due to the client not having finalized the solution and the limitations set by the organization admin, Iâ€™m currently unable to implement the chatbot feature.
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- I learned how to manage multiple pages effectively and explored the use of templates to speed up the page creation process. This helped maintain consistency across all pages. Moving forward, I should continue learning different templates and layouts to optimize page design and usability. Additionally, I will stay in close communication with the client to provide more detailed recommendations on solutions and get a more detailed user demand, which may help proceed the decision-making process for the chatbot implementation.Or they may choose other solution.
