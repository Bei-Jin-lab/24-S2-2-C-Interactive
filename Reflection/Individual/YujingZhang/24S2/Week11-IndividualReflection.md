### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- This week’s task was to create a user guide for the SharePoint version. My idea was to make it in the form of video tutorials and upload them to SharePoint for easy access by the client.
- Since the tutorial covered several topics, I divided the task into three parts, assigning each part to a different person. I took responsibility for explaining the homepage section components, as I am more familiar with that part.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- I learned that breaking down tasks and delegating them helps manage large workloads efficiently. Coordinating responsibilities also ensured that each person could focus on their area of expertise, leading to better results.
- Moving forward, I aim to improve my time management and communication with teammates to ensure everyone stays aligned and completes their tasks on time. Additionally, I will explore ways to make the video tutorials more engaging to enhance the client’s learning experience.
