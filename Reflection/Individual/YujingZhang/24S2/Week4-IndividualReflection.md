### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
- I revised the meeting template to improve how we conduct meetings. I added sections to record the meeting process and discussions, and moved tasks from the meeting to our project log. Previously, we didn’t send out an agenda or assign a note-taker before meetings, which led to disorganized sessions. To fix this, I prepared an agenda before meetings, and let every one know in advance.
-  I was responsible for communicating with stakeholders about tech risks, and I’ve received clear responses.  The main challenge we faced was that no one knew how to address the third-party technical support involved in this project.To tackle this, I went to ITS and talked with staff there and sent emails to the relevant stakeholders asking for advice. Their feedback was very helpful and had a significant impact on our subsequent evaluation of development methods, providing support for our actions.
- I discussed with Jinghan about our project log and the dimensions we should track. We need to link meeting minutes and related documents to the log.
- On the technical side, I researched WordPress and identified potential risks of using a low-code platform.
- I analyzed client’s requirements and write a features document to help us discuss and finalize development tasks and prototype.
- I found a good Agile video tutorial and shared it on Teams to help us better understand the process. 
### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
- I realized that when facing problems, it's important to reach out not only to direct stakeholders but also to all related stakeholders who might provide constructive feedback. For instance, in our communication with ITS, we learned from the tutor that similar situations have occurred in previous years, and the convenor also gave us suggestions for implementing the project. I believe this attempt to communicate with different people greatly benefited our decision-making process.
- Additionally,I learned the importance of proactively improving our processes. By gathering feedback from stakeholders and team members, I was able to enhance our communication flow and document management. This proactive approach allowed us to identify and solve issues quickly, which I believe significantly boosted our team’s efficiency and collaboration. Additionally, by applying the knowledge from the 6120 course on development processes, I was able to practically implement what I’ve learned about Agile like from the user stories to generate features. This experience has given me a deeper understanding of how these concepts work in real-world scenarios.
