# Week11 Individual Reflection
**Name**: Yujing Zhang

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

This week, our AI team focused on finalizing the chatbot. We added the support email at the end of the answers as the client requested. We also checked the user guide to make sure everything was clear and ready for the week 12 delivery. As usual, I was in charge of recording the meeting notes to keep track of the updates.

One challenge was making sure all parts of the chatbot and documents were complete and error-free. I worked with my team to double-check everything and made small improvements to get ready for the final submission.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  
I learned the importance of double-checking details before delivery. I also improved my teamwork and task tracking skills by helping the team get ready for the final week. I hope to keep learning how to manage final reviews and deliver high-quality work on time.
