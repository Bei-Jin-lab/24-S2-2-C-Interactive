### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I focused on implementing design changes based on client feedback. The client emphasized the need to follow ANU’s visual standards, including specific font styles. However, I encountered a challenge: the default components in WordPress did not support the required fonts.

To address this, I took the initiative to learn more about the WordPress editor, exploring ways to customize styles beyond its basic options. I experimented with the Advanced CSS Editor and found a way to import external fonts. Additionally, I modified the website’s appearance by writing custom PHP and CSS code to apply the correct font format across different elements. Through this process, I successfully updated the website’s typography to meet the required visual standards.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  

This experience helped me improve my problem-solving skills and deepen my understanding of WordPress customization. I gained more confidence in working with CSS and PHP to control website appearance at a deeper level. Moving forward, I plan to further explore WordPress customization and improve efficiency in implementing design changes.
