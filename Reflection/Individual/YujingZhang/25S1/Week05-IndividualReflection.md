### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- Updated 2 User scenarios and 12 user stories to project repository.
- Write the Meeting log for Client meeting.
- Write Data Collection Operation Document And sort the Data document structure.
- Data Wrangling : check the integrety of data files from one peers

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  
A major challenge we encountered was data loss and  during storage. Some files saving to pdf will loss some link or text. To solve this, we decided to cross-check each otherâ€™s collected data and establish a priority comment column for sorting and verifying files content. This approach helped us improve data accuracy and ensure all necessary records were properly maintained.

Through this process, I improved my attention to detail and data validation skills. Verifying data integrity required careful examination and collaboration with teammates. By implementing a cross-checking system, I learned the importance of structured workflows in preventing errors and maintaining reliable documentation. Moving forward, I will continue refining our data management process and ensure that all collected information is organized efficiently.
