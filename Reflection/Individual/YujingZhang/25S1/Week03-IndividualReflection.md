### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  
- **Improved Documentation Skills**:  
  - To manage multiple tasks, I created a priority list and focused on completing the most time-sensitive items first (e.g., meeting minutes and client meeting summaries). Then sorted the log.
 
  - This week, I gained a deeper understanding of the ducumentation. And I plan to improve my ability to anticipate potential risks and document them proactively in the **Risk Log**, ensuring the team is better prepared for future challenges.
