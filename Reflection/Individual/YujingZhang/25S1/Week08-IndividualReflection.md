**Name**: Yujing Zhang

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, our main task was to collaboratively write a guidebook on customer-independent training for AI chatbots. I contributed to outlining the structure of the guide.
At the same time, I continued my responsibility of recording and organizing our weekly team meeting, ensuring all updates and decisions were accurately documented.

A major challenge was balancing technical depth with clarity in the guidebook, since the intended audience included both technical and non-technical users. To overcome this, I worked closely with teammates to simplify complex concepts using real examples and diagrams. I also revised my sections based on peer feedback to improve readability and coherence.


### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  

This week helped me strengthen my technical writing skills, especially in explaining AI-related concepts clearly for a broader audience. I also learned more about scalable chatbot training approaches and how to structure content collaboratively in a team setting. Going forward, I hope to continue improving the clarity and impact of my writing while deepening my understanding of AI chatbot deployment in real-world use cases.
