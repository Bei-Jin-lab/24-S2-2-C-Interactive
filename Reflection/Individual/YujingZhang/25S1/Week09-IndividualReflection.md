### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, besides writing the meeting notes, I worked with my team to design the showcase poster. We used what we learned from the website UI improvements to choose a consistent theme color. We also looked back at the problems from last semesterâ€™s poster, like the font being too big. This time, we adjusted the font size, added more content and graphics, and made sure everything matched the marking criteria.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  

I learned how to apply design knowledge to make a poster that looks clear and professional. I also improved my teamwork and design thinking by fixing past mistakes and focusing on what the judges expect. I hope to keep improving my visual communication and presentation skills.
