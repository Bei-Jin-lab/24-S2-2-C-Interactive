### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I worked on improving the AI chatbot user guide, especially the part about how to write and use prompts. I also wrote the meeting notes after our client meeting to record all feedback and next steps.

One challenge was making the guide easy to understand for both technical and non-technical users. I solved this by working with my team to make the language simpler, add examples, and give clear tips. I also updated my writing based on feedback from others.



### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  

I learned how to explain technical things more clearly for different users. I also improved my writing and teamwork skills. This helped me understand more about chatbot training and how to write useful guides.
