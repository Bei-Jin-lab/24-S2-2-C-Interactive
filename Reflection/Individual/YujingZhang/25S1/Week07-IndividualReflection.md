**Name**: Yujing Zhang

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
This week, I was responsible for recording and organizing both the tutor meeting and the team meeting. I carefully noted down all the key discussion points, decisions, and task allocations, and updated our meeting logs accordingly to ensure clear communication within the team. Additionally, I started the initial training of our AI chatbot.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  

Through these tasks, I developed better attention to detail in documentation and strengthened my skills in team coordination. The chatbot training process also deepened my understanding of conversational AI and the importance of training data quality. I learned how even small changes in phrasing can affect the AI’s responses. Next, I aim to explore more advanced training techniques and further enhance the bot’s usability.
