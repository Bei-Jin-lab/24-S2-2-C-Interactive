# Week 8 Individual Reflection  
**Name**: Yiou Liu  

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?  
- Focused on researching the WordPress plugin WPForms, particularly for its post-submission functionality.
- Discovered that the basic version of WPForms only supports submitting forms, which triggers an email to a specified address.
- Identified two solutions for enabling direct post submissions on the webpage without accessing the WordPress backend:
  1. Upgrading to the WPForms Pro version to use the Post Submissions Addon, allowing users to submit content from the frontend directly onto the page.
  2. Opting for a custom code solution to achieve the same functionality.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?  
- Gained a deeper understanding of WordPress plugins, especially WPForms, and how to extend its functionality beyond basic form submissions.
- Improved my problem-solving abilities by exploring multiple approaches (plugin upgrade vs. custom code) to achieve the desired feature.
- Enhanced my technical evaluation skills by comparing the cost and effort between upgrading the plugin and implementing a custom-coded solution.
