# Week 4 Individual Reflection

**Name: Yiou**

## 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

- **Meetings Participation:** Attended the **Friday client meeting** and the **tutor meeting with Zara**, where we discussed current progress and clarified the upcoming deliverables.
- **Clarifying Requirements:** Continued to take notes on key discussion points to keep the team aligned.
- **Weekly Report Drafting:** Contributed to writing the **Weekly Report**, outlining our progress and identifying action items.
- **Technical Task â€“ Data Collection:** **Manually collected data** from **Canva SharePoint pages** to prepare training data for our chatbot model. The process involved identifying relevant content, ensuring accuracy, and formatting data consistently.

**Challenge:**  
While collecting data manually, I encountered difficulties in navigating and selecting information that was both relevant and clean for model training.  
**Solution:**  
I addressed this by first establishing clear criteria with the team for what content to include, then double-checking formatting consistency before adding it to the dataset.

## 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

- **Improved Attention to Detail:** The data collection task taught me to be more meticulous and consistent, especially when preparing content for downstream AI training.
- **Clearer Communication:** Regular meetings helped me communicate more effectively and confirm understanding of tasks.
- **Time Management:** Balanced report writing and data collection efficiently within limited available time.

This week allowed me to strengthen both my soft and technical skills, especially in handling content for machine learning use, which is new and exciting to me.
