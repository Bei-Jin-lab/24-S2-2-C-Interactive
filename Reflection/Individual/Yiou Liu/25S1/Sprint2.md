### Sprint 2 Individual Reflection  
**Name:** Yiou Liu  

#### 1. What have I done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

During Sprint 2, my main technical contribution was to **fix and enhance the upload functionality** on our WordPress website. Specifically, I ensured that uploaded content would correctly display a **timestamp** and support **image attachments**, which had not been working as expected in the earlier version. This task required me to explore the backend structure of our WordPress environment, debug the plugin behavior, and test for compatibility across different types of content. Although Iâ€™m not very experienced in PHP or WordPress development, I consulted documentation, tested iteratively, and communicated with teammates to ensure that the new features were robust and user-friendly.

In addition to development work, I continued to take part in **group reflection writing** and **regular meetings** with both our client and tutor. I helped draft parts of the Sprint Report and ensured that our shared documents reflected team discussions accurately. I also maintained regular attendance and contribution during internal meetings to stay aligned with group goals and support decision-making.

#### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

This sprint helped me become more **confident in engaging with unfamiliar technical stacks**. While WordPress was new to me, working on its customization deepened my understanding of how modular systems can be extended with relatively small code changes. It also trained my **problem-solving skills in a live environment**, where small bugs can affect the usability of the entire site.

Moreover, I continued to improve my **team communication** and **documentation habits**, both in verbal discussions and written reports. Although my role this sprint was more focused on a single task, it still allowed me to **strengthen my sense of responsibility** for the user-facing aspects of the project.
