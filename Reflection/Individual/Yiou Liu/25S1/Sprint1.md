###  Sprint 1 Individual Reflection  
**Name:** Yiou Liu  

#### 1. What have I done? What challenges and how did I solve them?

During Sprint 1, I mainly contributed to the **manual data collection process** for chatbot training and took responsibility for **drafting and consolidating the team’s weekly reports**. In the data collection phase, I sourced Q&A content from university websites such as SharePoint and Canvas, ensuring that the content was relevant and formatted according to our documentation standards. Although the work was repetitive, I paid particular attention to **accuracy, consistency, and traceability**, which are essential for the quality of our training data.

Meanwhile, I took the initiative to **summarize our team’s progress and challenges in weekly reports**. This required staying up-to-date with everyone’s work, cross-checking task completion, and maintaining a clear timeline of our sprint deliverables. It also involved translating informal discussions into clear and professional documentation that could be shared with both the tutor and the client.

A key challenge was **balancing detail and clarity** when describing team activities in a concise way. I overcame this by gathering input from each member and structuring our reports to highlight both technical and collaborative efforts.

#### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?

Through this process, I realized the value of **reliable execution and communication support** in a collaborative team project. Even though I wasn’t leading a specific feature, my involvement in documentation and data work allowed me to see the bigger picture and understand how different components (front-end, data, AI) interact.

I also improved my **technical attention to detail**, especially when validating data integrity and formatting. Writing the weekly reports helped me strengthen my **communication and synthesis skills**, particularly in formal written expression and summarizing complex progress into digestible formats. This role deepened my understanding of project workflows and enhanced my sense of ownership in team collaboration.
