### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- In Sprint 3, I created the PowerPoint slides for the website introduction video and fixed several bugs, including incorrect category redirects for newly published articles. I solved this by editing the functions.php file. I also added a short introduction to the top of the navigation bar and wrote a user guide to help future team members maintain and improve the site. These tasks went smoothly after careful testing.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- During this sprint, I improved my ability to debug WordPress issues and gained a deeper understanding of how theme files like functions.php control website behavior. I also learned how to communicate technical instructions clearly through documentation. Creating the user guide helped me organize the development process more effectively and consider the needs of future users and developers.
