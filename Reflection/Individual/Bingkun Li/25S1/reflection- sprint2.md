*  100-200 words
* Can use bullet points or write a summary (answer belows question)

### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- In Sprint 2, I presented our website project progress to the Dean of CBE and our client. Based on their feedback, we improved the website’s structure by adding three subpages—News, Canvas, and Seminars—to the top navigation bar. This change allows uploaded articles to be categorized and displayed accordingly, making content easier to manage and navigate.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- I learned how to translate stakeholder feedback into practical design improvements. This sprint also helped me strengthen my skills in information architecture and responsive content organization, which will be valuable for future development phases.
