### 1. What have been done? What challenges and how did I solve them?
*Describe what tasks, processes, or what went smoothly.*

- This week, we extracted and cleaned data from the Canvas website and modified the UI of the WordPress site to align with ANU style. However, we encountered a limitation in the WordPress template that prevented the top menu from spanning the full width of the page. To resolve this, we are attempting to modify the CSS, adjust theme settings, or use custom HTML to ensure the menu displays correctly and maintains the site's overall aesthetics.

### 2. Reflection: What did I learn or improve?
*Share any new knowledge, skills, or insights gained.*

- This week, I learned the standards for website data extraction and the detailed process of modifying website UI. Additionally, I improved my ability to troubleshoot UI issues in WordPress, enhancing my problem-solving skills and understanding of CSS adjustments to ensure a more polished and functional website design.
