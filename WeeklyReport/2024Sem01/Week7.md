## 1. What Weâ€™ve Done:
*Describe the tasks that were completed this week.*

- **Task 1: React Development and Prototype Comparison** [Progress: 90%]  
  Bei Jin developed the website's homepage using React, focusing on creating a dynamic and responsive user experience. Bingkun Li added interactive elements but due to security concerns, the team decided to abandon the React version and continue with WordPress and SharePoint for better support and compliance with ANU's security requirements. Additionally, the team compiled a comparison table listing the pros and cons of React, WordPress, and SharePoint, which was presented to the client for decision-making.

- **Task 2: AI Chatbot Integration with SharePoint** [Progress: 85%]  
  Jinghan Gao explored integrating an AI chatbot with SharePoint using Chatbase. He gathered data from ANU policy documents and tested the free version of Chatbase, discovering that the platform was aligned with project needs. However, limitations with the free version meant that funding would be required to unlock advanced features.

- **Task 3: WordPress Plugin Research and Security Evaluation** [Progress: 80%]  
  Yiou Liu researched WordPress plugins and evaluated the possibility of using WordPress for the project, with a focus on maintainability, security, and cost. She also investigated whether ANU IT would support WordPress deployment and how it fit into the existing infrastructure.

- **Task 4: SharePoint Development and Customization** [Progress: 85%]  
  Yujing Zhang worked on developing custom SharePoint solutions, writing technical documentation and analyzing how different features, like a chatbot, could be integrated. She also faced challenges setting up a local development environment for SharePoint due to permission requirements.
