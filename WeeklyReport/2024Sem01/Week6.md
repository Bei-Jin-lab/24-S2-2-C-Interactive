## 1. What We’ve Done:
*Describe the tasks that were completed this week.*

- **Task 1: Initial Java-Spring Boot Development (System Architecture)** [Progress: 90%]  
  Earlier in the project, Yiou Liu and Yujing Zhang developed the system architecture and UML diagrams using Java-Spring Boot. This was part of the initial backend design, focusing on key components like posting content and managing system logs. These plans were meant to guide backend development, but after the decision was made to shift to SharePoint, this work was halted.

- **Task 2: Transition to SharePoint and Website Development** [Progress: 85%]  
  The team shifted from Java-Spring Boot to SharePoint due to client requirements, particularly regarding security. Bei Jin and Bingkun Li led the effort in transitioning to SharePoint by developing the user interface and homepage. They faced challenges in adapting to SharePoint’s limitations but overcame these by using custom web parts and integrating advanced features through SharePoint’s tools. Yiou Liu contributed to designing and customizing the SharePoint pages to meet the project’s usability needs. Jinsong Xin worked on finalizing the homepage design, ensuring that the layout and user interface met the project’s expectations.

- **Task 3: Project Documentation and Preparation for Audit 2** [Progress: 95%]  
  Jinghan Gao managed various project logs and documentation in preparation for Audit 2. This included reviewing feedback and updating logs such as the feedback and task logs to ensure they aligned with client feedback and project goals. The team also revised the initial project approach based on the feedback from the presentation, adapting it to fit the SharePoint platform.

## 2. Issues & Help Needed:
**Write down the problems.**

- **Issue 1: SharePoint Customization** [Urgency: Medium] - [Help Needed: SharePoint Development Support]  
  Several team members found SharePoint's customization options limited, especially when implementing advanced functions. Additional support is required for complex feature integration, including custom web parts and Power Automate workflows.

- **Issue 2: Domain and Permissions Delay** [Urgency: High] - [Help Needed: Coordination with ANU ITS]  
  A lack of domain and permission grants from ANU ITS has delayed deployment on the university servers. The team decided to develop locally in the interim but will require support to transition the project to ANU servers once approvals are in place.

## 3. Next Steps:
- **Task 1: Finalize SharePoint Website Development** [Responsible: Bei Jin, Bingkun Li, Yiou Liu, Jinsong Xin]  
  The team will focus on completing the user interface and refining SharePoint-based features to ensure the website is functional and meets client needs.

- **Task 2: Continue Documentation and Log Maintenance** [Responsible: Jinghan Gao, Yujing Zhang]  
  The documentation team will continue maintaining logs and preparing final documentation for Audit 2. Feedback will be incorporated to ensure the project stays aligned with client goals.
