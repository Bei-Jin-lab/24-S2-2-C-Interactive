## 1. We Done：
- Task 1: Website case analysis and performance improvement planning [Progress: 100%] </br>
  Bei Jin and Bingkun Li conducted a thorough analysis of the case website provided by the tutor. They identified both the strengths and weaknesses of the existing site, particularly focusing on user experience and design aesthetics. The team discussed how to avoid the shortcomings of the existing site while improving the performance of the new website we plan to build. This task was essential for laying the groundwork for our project's overall strategy. Bei Jin also analyzed potential risks associated with our website and proposed mitigation strategies.
- Task 2: Backend and frontend tech stack discussions [Progress: 80%]</br>
  Yujing Zhang, Yiou Liu, and Yunru Chen engaged in an in-depth discussion regarding the backend technologies that could be used for the project. They evaluated several options, including traditional coding methods, WordPress, and GitHub Pages, focusing on how each option would integrate with the frontend. The discussion also included evaluating the ease of use, maintenance, and scalability of these technologies. Yiou Liu led the backend discussions, ensuring that the chosen stack would align with both frontend needs and project requirements.
- Task 3:  Communication with ANU IT Support and client meetings [Progress: 90%]</br>
  Jinghan Gao managed the communication with stakeholders, including ANU IT Support, to secure backend database access necessary for user authentication. They also discussed the integration of an AI chatbot with the client, balancing the benefits of self-trained models versus pre-existing large models. The discussions with the client helped refine the project direction, especially regarding the technical feasibility and user needs. Additionally, Yujing Zhang documented all key points during these meetings and created a standardized meeting template to improve documentation efficiency in future interactions.

## 2. Issues & Help Needed
- Issue 1: Delay in domain name approval from ANU [Urgency: High] - [Help Needed: Coordination with ANU IT Support]</br>
The ANU has not yet processed our domain name application, which is delaying the deployment of our website. This issue is critical as it affects our timeline for testing and client feedback. We need to follow up with ANU IT Support to expedite this process.
- Issue 2: Integration challenges between backend and frontend [Urgency: Medium] - [Help Needed: Technical advice on best practices]</br>
During the integration discussions, some challenges were identified in ensuring smooth communication between the backend and frontend. Specific issues include handling API requests and database connectivity. We might need external technical advice to resolve these issues efficiently and ensure that the integration is robust and scalable.
