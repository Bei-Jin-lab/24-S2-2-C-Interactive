2 phases in the project: 

Develop a staff-oriented website  

Have a look at CASS Education Design Studio - Home (sharepoint.com) 

What are the pros and cons of the CASS website and how you would improve it? 

Existing CBE Wordpress site that needs to be developed Home - CBE Education (anu.edu.au) 

What are the options available if we need to build an ANU hosted site?  

Information about the WP site (see end of this doc) 

We need to ensure the website is easy to use and manage (especially for anyone from a non web design background to take over) and looks nice. Also, we need to make sure it adheres to ANU policies and procedures.  

Contact: log a ticket in IT service desk or contact web.cbe@anu.edu.au  

Expected deadline: Sem 2 2024 

Develop an AI chatbot (we may update the requirements during the project): 

What are the current options? What are the pros and cons?  

How can we feed college-specific data into the chatbot?  

How easy is it to integrate into the website and maintain?  

How accurate is the chatbot?  

Are there are any costs for the chatbot?  

Are there any security concerns about the chatbot? 

Expected deadline: a prototype built and embedded by Sem 2 2024 and a full version by Sem 1 2025. Also, we may need to extend the chatbot to other areas such as student services etc. (i.e., make it student-oriented or general public-oriented) 

 

 

Information from ITS about the WP site 

As to your other query, we want to clarify that our standard support and management services primarily focus on Drupal websites that comply with University guidelines. However, for WordPress sites, we offer hosting services exclusively and have recently migrated to the WPEngine platform to streamline ongoing maintenance. This transition allows us to leverage the Gutenberg editor and a curated selection of plugins. Gutenberg provides a more intuitive and visual content creation experience by breaking content into modular blocks, such as paragraphs, images, galleries, quotes, and embeds. Users can easily customize layouts through drag-and-drop functionality without the need for HTML or CSS coding. Its user-friendly interface replaces traditional editors, offering greater flexibility in designing WordPress websites. This approach optimizes platform management and addresses the evolving support needs of WordPress sites.  

 

Our team facilitated the migration process due to the impending end-of-life status of the Weblogs platform, which hosted numerous WordPress websites across various university areas. The outdated WordPress versions and infrastructure of Weblogs posed significant security risks, necessitating a transition. 

 

We've assisted numerous stakeholders across the University during this migration, given the substantial volume of affected websites and our capacity constraints. In most cases, websites are being set up on WPEngine, with customers asked to migrate their content which entails a fresh build. However, for complex or smaller sites like yours, our team handles the migration process to ensure a smooth transition.  

 

To support ongoing management, your new site includes all necessary tools and licensed plugins for security, reliability, performance, and user-friendliness. You'll have access to the WordPress Gutenberg page editor and a wide array of drag-and-drop blocks, making it as simple as using Microsoft Word to create your desired layout. Sharing the below for guidance:  

ANU’s WPEngine offering: 

Must be built using Gutenberg editor. No third-party page builders. 

Greenshift block plugins provided, including dynamic fields and all premium features. 

Greenshift FSE theme recommended as a starting point.

No access to the underlying filesystem. 

Allowed plugins (additional plugins will need security review):
