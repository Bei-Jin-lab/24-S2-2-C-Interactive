# Project Name: Education Website Development

**Project Background:**  
The project team developed three technical solution demos (SharePoint, WordPress, and React) and presented them to the client on September 23, 2024. The client focused on the security and aesthetics of the website and ultimately decided to proceed with both the SharePoint and WordPress solutions, rejecting the React solution.

## Decision Log

**Date: September 23, 2024**

### Decision: Present three demos and the client selects to develop SharePoint and WordPress solutions in parallel  
**Participants:** Project Team, Client  
**Decision Background:**  
The project team spent a week developing demos for three technical solutions: SharePoint, WordPress, and React. During the September 23 meeting, the client reviewed the pros and cons of each solution:

- **SharePoint Solution:**  
  - **Pros:** High security, closely integrated with ANU's existing systems, and meets the client’s basic requirements.  
  - **Cons:** Lacks aesthetic appeal, has limited learning resources, and a long audit time.  

- **WordPress Solution:**  
  - **Pros:** Visually appealing, supports basic features such as file uploads, search, and AI chatbots, with relatively low costs.  
  - **Cons:** Lower security, less integration with ANU systems, and potential plugin compatibility issues.  

- **React Solution:**  
  - **Pros:** Highly customizable, optimized performance, suitable for developing complex, dynamic applications.  
  - **Cons:** Difficult to maintain, especially for novice developers, and has frequent updates and security issues, such as cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Decision Result:**  
The client rejected the React solution due to high maintenance difficulties. They expressed interest in both the SharePoint and WordPress solutions. The SharePoint solution offers strong security but lacks aesthetics, while WordPress is visually appealing but has lower security. The client also stated that it is acceptable not to use ANU accounts for logging into the website. Ultimately, the client decided to proceed with both SharePoint and WordPress solutions in parallel, allowing further improvement before making a final decision.

**Next Steps:**
- **SharePoint Solution:**  
  The development team will focus on improving the user interface design to address the lack of visual appeal while leveraging its security and integration with ANU systems for added functionality.

- **WordPress Solution:**  
  The team will work on enhancing WordPress’s security, particularly when integrating AI chatbots and file upload functionalities, ensuring strict security measures and optimizing plugin compatibility.

The estimated development time is 1 to 2 weeks, after which the client will make a final decision based on the progress of both solutions.
