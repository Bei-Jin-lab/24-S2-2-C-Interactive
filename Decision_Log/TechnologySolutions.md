| **Plan A: SPFx Local Development**                           | Developer must have a SharePoint tenant                      | Request SharePoint admin permission from Uni ITS                 | Chatbot service (USD 99/M)                                          | Full control over development with flexible customization options. Leverages existing infrastructure. | Delays in obtaining admin permissions from Uni ITS may affect timeline. ANU IT audit time. | 5-7 weeks + audit time. | High scalability for adding new features and components.                                                         |
| **Plan B: SPFx Local Development + Handover**                | SharePoint tenant must be an organization with a Tax ID      | Register a new tenant for development, hand over to Uni ITS      | SharePoint tenant service (19AU /p/M )and chatbot service (USD 99/M) | Combines flexible local development with smooth handover to Uni ITS for deployment.                   | Additional cost for tenant registration and potential handover delays. ANU IT audit time.                    | 5-7 weeks + audit time.              | High scalability for adding new features and components. |
| **Plan C: Online Development + Embedded Chatbot (Chatbase)** | Embedded content must be on an approved site list (Uni ITS)  | Confirm the site list with ANU or purchase service for testing   | Chatbot service (USD 99/M)                                          | Quick implementation with basic functionality. Suitable for projects with minimal customization needs. | Limited customization, may not meet long-term project requirements. ANU IT audit time.                       | 2-4 weeks + audit time.              | Limited scalability due to lack of customization capabilities.     |

Note:Why ChatBase? Because it has been used in other ANU SP site.So the audit failure risk is low.
