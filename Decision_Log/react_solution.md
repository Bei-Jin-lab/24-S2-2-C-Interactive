<br>Sample website: https://b_3rcpmmo.v0.build/

Advantages: 
<br> Highly flexible, providing a high degree of customization. Using virtual DOM to improve performance, can develop complex and dynamic web applications.

Its usage and integration with the backend may cause some security risks, such as Cross-site scripting (XSS).
