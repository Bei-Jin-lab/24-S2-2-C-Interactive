## 2. Summary Conclusion

After comparison, the traditional React method stands out in several key areas, particularly in **security**, **real-time data processing and complex API integration**, and **complex permission and role control**. Despite the higher initial development difficulty, React offers long-term flexibility and scalability, making it the best choice for front-end implementation in this project. In contrast, WordPress and other options are more suited for simpler or medium-sized projects, while React is better equipped to meet the demands of larger and more complex projects.

## 3. Detailed Technical Analysis

### 1. **Traditional React Method**
- **Maintainability**: React projects require regular updates to dependencies and code maintenance. While this requires some technical background, React provides long-term stability and flexibility, allowing the project to adapt to changing requirements.
- **Cost**: React has higher initial development costs, especially in terms of time and technical investment. However, React's high flexibility and scalability make it more cost-effective over the project lifecycle.
- **Build Difficulty**: React demands solid front-end development knowledge, such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. Although development is challenging, React's modular and component-based development model offers greater flexibility for complex projects.
- **Database Integration Difficulty**: React can be highly customized according to project needs, especially suitable for complex database integration scenarios, enabling powerful data interaction and processing capabilities.
- **Security**: React has a small attack surface with no direct database interaction in the front-end, making it highly secure. Regular updates to dependencies help maintain project security. Overall, React is highly secure, suitable for projects with high security requirements.
- **Real-Time Data, Data Processing, Complex API Integration**: React has strong real-time data processing and complex API integration capabilities, making it highly adaptable to complex project needs, especially in scenarios involving large data processing and real-time communication.
- **Complex Permission and Role Control**: React can work closely with the back-end to support highly customizable permission management and role control, meeting the needs of complex projects.

### 2. **WordPress**
- **Maintainability**: WordPress is known for its intuitive user interface, making it easy for non-technical users to maintain the site. However, as the number of plugins increases, the complexity of maintenance also increases, relying on third-party plugin security and update frequency.
- **Cost**: WordPress is open-source, but requires payment for hosting, domain, and some plugins or themes. While initial costs are low, costs may increase as the site scales.
- **Build Difficulty**: WordPress has a low build difficulty, requiring no coding. Users can quickly build a site using built-in editors and plugins, suitable for beginners and quick development scenarios.
- **Database Integration Difficulty**: WordPress has built-in database support, typically making database operations easy. However, for complex database needs, it may require plugins, and plugin updates and compatibility issues could increase maintenance difficulty.
- **Security**: Due to WordPress's extensive plugin ecosystem, each plugin may introduce potential security vulnerabilities. Although WordPress core and plugins are frequently updated, regular maintenance is necessary to ensure security.
- **Real-Time Data, Data Processing, Complex API Integration**: WordPress is suitable for basic API integration and data processing, but may face performance bottlenecks in complex data scenarios. Additionally, it does not support WebSocket, limiting its performance in real-time applications.
- **Complex Permission and Role Control**: WordPress's user roles and permission management mechanisms are relatively fixed, suitable for simple permission control, but with limited scalability in complex scenarios.

### 3. **GitHub Pages + Jekyll**
- **Maintainability**: GitHub Pages and Jekyll static sites are relatively easy to maintain, suitable for simple content display. However, they are limited in expansion and require some technical background to manage and update.
- **Cost**: GitHub Pages is free, and Jekyll is open-source, making the initial cost very low. However, as the project's complexity increases, functionality extension may become difficult, leading to increased costs.
- **Build Difficulty**: Although Jekyll's build difficulty is lower than pure code development, it still requires learning Jekyll and Markdown syntax and mastering deployment on GitHub, suitable for simple static websites, but not for complex projects.
- **Database Integration Difficulty**: Jekyll is not suitable for dynamic content integration and cannot directly support complex database needs. If database integration is required, it usually needs to be done through APIs, which significantly increases complexity.
- **Security**: As a static site, GitHub Pages and Jekyll have a small attack surface, making them relatively secure. However, security largely depends on GitHub and Jekyll's configuration, which may not be sufficient for complex applications.
- **Real-Time Data, Data Processing, Complex API Integration**: Jekyll does not support real-time data processing and is not suitable for complex API integration, with limited functionality expansion, suitable for simple website display, not for complex data interaction scenarios.
- **Complex Permission and Role Control**: Jekyll and GitHub Pages lack permission management capabilities, making them unsuitable for projects requiring complex role control.

### 4. **SharePoint**
- **Maintainability**: SharePoint is developed by Microsoft, with an intuitive interface that is easy to maintain. Its integration with Microsoft Office tools allows non-technical users to manage content easily, making it very suitable for enterprise-level projects requiring simple, rapid deployment.
- **Cost**: SharePoint typically requires a Microsoft 365 subscription, with costs covering hosting, security, and technical support. While initial costs are moderate, they may increase with customization needs.
- **Build Difficulty**: SharePoint has a low build difficulty, requiring no coding. Users can quickly build a website using drag-and-drop components and templates. However, its UI design may not meet all aesthetic requirements, limiting its application in some complex projects.
- **Database Integration Difficulty**: SharePoint has strong built-in database support, capable of seamless integration with Microsoft SQL Server and other services, suitable for enterprise-level database needs. However, due to its reliance on the Microsoft ecosystem, its customization and flexibility may not be as strong as other methods.
- **Security**: SharePoint provides enterprise-grade security measures, suitable for applications requiring high security. However, it relies on Microsoft services, with lower control over security measures and customization.
- **Real-Time Data, Data Processing, Complex API Integration**: SharePoint supports basic data processing and API integration, suitable for medium complexity scenarios but may struggle with large-scale real-time data processing and complex API integration.
- **Complex Permission and Role Control**: SharePoint has built-in permission management mechanisms suitable for enterprise-level structures, but customization for highly complex permission management may require specialized development knowledge and can be challenging to extend.

---

**Final Conclusion**: The traditional React method emerges as the best choice for front-end development in this project due to its superior scalability, security, and ability to handle complex project requirements. While the initial development difficulty is higher, React offers significant flexibility and long-term maintainability, making it particularly suitable for projects with complex needs.
