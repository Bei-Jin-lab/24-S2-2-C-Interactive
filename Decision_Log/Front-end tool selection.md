# 1. Traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript Development
- Ease of Maintenance:
 High difficulty. It requires a deep understanding of the code. Non-technical users may find it hard to maintain, and ongoing technical support might be needed.
- CBE Experience: 
If CBE hasn’t used this method before, it can be challenging for beginners to understand and use, making it harder to get started.
- Cost: 
High. Developing and maintaining the site can be costly, as you might need to hire professional developers for both initial setup and ongoing maintenance.
- Building Difficulty:
 High. It requires strong knowledge of front-end development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Integration with Backend Databases:
 Depends on the developer's skills. It can achieve high customization, but the process can be complex and challenging.
- Exporting and Future Development:
 All code is hand-written, so it can be fully exported and modified later, but future changes will be costly and require strong technical skills.

 # 2. Using GitHub Pages and Jekyll
- Ease of Maintenance:
 Moderate. Jekyll is relatively simple but still requires some technical background to maintain and update. Its static nature may limit future expansion.
- CBE Experience:
 If CBE has no experience with Jekyll, understanding and using it might be difficult for beginners.
- Cost:
 Low. GitHub Pages offers free hosting, and Jekyll is open-source with no extra fees, but development and maintenance still require some technical knowledge.
- Building Difficulty:
 Moderate. Not as complex as pure HTML/CSS/JS but still requires learning Jekyll and Markdown syntax, as well as deploying on GitHub.
- Integration with Backend Databases:
 Not ideal for dynamic content. It’s challenging to integrate with a backend database and requires API use for complex setups.
- Exporting and Future Development:
 Jekyll generates static HTML files, which can be exported and directly modified, but it lacks the flexibility of dynamic sites.

 # 3. Using WordPress
- Ease of Maintenance:
 Very easy. WordPress has an intuitive admin interface, allowing non-technical users to easily maintain the site. CBE already has experience with WordPress, making it even easier to get started.
- CBE Experience:
 CBE is familiar with WordPress, so it’s easy to understand and use. You can leverage existing knowledge and experience for building and maintaining the site.
- Cost:
 Moderate. WordPress is open-source and free, but you’ll need to pay for hosting, domain names, and possibly premium plugins and themes. Overall, it's cheaper than hand-coded sites but might cost slightly more than Jekyll.
- Building Difficulty:
 Low. No need to write code. You can build the site using built-in editors and plugins. Even beginners can quickly get up to speed, and development time is short.
- Integration with Backend Databases: 
Very smooth. WordPress comes with built-in database support, and the plugin ecosystem makes database operations easier. It also supports remote MySQL databases.
- Exporting and Future Development:
 WordPress code can be exported and further modified, but it’s more complex than hand-coded sites. You’ll need to understand WordPress’s internal structure to make changes.
# 4. Using SharePoint
- Ease of Maintenance:
  Very easy. SharePoint is designed for non-technical users and offers a highly intuitive interface, making content management and updates straightforward. It integrates well with Microsoft Office tools, making it convenient for users already familiar with these platforms.
- CBE Experience:
  CBE has experience with Microsoft Office and related tools, so using SharePoint will be easy to get started with. Additionally, SharePoint offers many built-in features, reducing the learning curve.
- Cost:
  Moderate. SharePoint is part of Microsoft's offerings and typically requires a subscription to Microsoft 365 or similar services, which incurs some cost. However, this cost includes hosting, security, and technical support, making it potentially more cost-effective than traditional development methods.
- Building Difficulty:
Low. No coding is required; users can build websites by dragging and dropping components, using templates, and setting up simple rules. Even beginners can quickly get up to speed, and development time is short. However, the UI design might not be very aesthetically pleasing.
- Integration with Backend Databases:
  Very smooth. SharePoint offers robust built-in database support and can seamlessly integrate with other Microsoft services like SQL Server. It also supports remote data access and complex workflow management.
- Exporting and Future Development:
  Some complexity involved. While SharePoint allows for exporting and modification, it relies on Microsoft's architecture and services, so custom development might require specialized knowledge. Future changes typically need an understanding of SharePoint's structure and workings.
# Conclusion
After comparing the four development methods, WordPress emerges as the preferred choice for website building due to its clear advantages:

1. Ease of Maintenance:  
   WordPress is the easiest to maintain. It provides an intuitive admin interface, allowing non-technical users to easily update content and manage the site. In contrast, traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript development is difficult to maintain and requires professional technical support. GitHub Pages and Jekyll are simpler than hand-coded sites but still require some technical background. While SharePoint is easy to maintain, it falls short in terms of aesthetic appeal.

2. CBE Experience: 
   CBE already has some experience with WordPress, which means the team can quickly get started and leverage existing knowledge for building and maintaining the site. Traditional development methods and Jekyll are not beginner-friendly, with a steep learning curve. Although CBE has experience with Microsoft Office, SharePoint's limitations in design aesthetics may hinder the optimization of user experience.

3. Cost:
   WordPress has moderate costs. While it requires payments for hosting, domain names, and some plugins or themes, the overall cost is reasonable and offers good value for money. Traditional development methods are expensive, requiring professional developers. GitHub Pages and Jekyll have low costs but are limited in terms of dynamic expansion. SharePoint has moderate costs, which are justified by its functionality and ease of use.

4. Building Difficulty:  
   WordPress has the lowest building difficulty, with no coding required, allowing even beginners to quickly build a site. In contrast, traditional methods require strong front-end development knowledge, while Jekyll requires learning Markdown and deployment techniques. SharePoint is easy to build with, but its UI lacks aesthetic appeal.

5. Integration with Backend Databases:
   WordPress excels in database integration, offering built-in support and a plugin ecosystem that simplifies database operations. Traditional methods have a complexity that depends on the developer's skills, while Jekyll is not suited for dynamic content integration. SharePoint integrates smoothly but is limited to Microsoft's ecosystem.

# Preference:
Overall, WordPress is easier to maintain and offers a higher level of aesthetics, making it the best choice. Traditional development methods, while flexible, are complex and hard to maintain; GitHub Pages and Jekyll are suitable for static sites but lack dynamic functionality, and while SharePoint is easy to maintain, it is less aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, WordPress is the optimal choice to meet CBE's needs.
