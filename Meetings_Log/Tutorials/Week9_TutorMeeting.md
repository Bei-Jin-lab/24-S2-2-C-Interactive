## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1: Shaodw team presentation for what they had done for last 2 weeks
Andy emphasized the need to prepare for upcoming project deadlines. He advised the team to plan ahead and ensure all tasks are completed in a timely manner. He highlighted the importance of starting on time and staying on schedule to avoid last-minute rushes.
Andy reminded the team that submissions should be in PDF format, and all video QR code should be correctly included. It wil due today.

Andy mentioned that the team should prepare for feedback sessions from the audit 3 in the following week. He encouraged the team to leverage feedback to improve their project and maximize learning opportunities. He noted that if any team members are applying for jobs or internships, they should utilize feedback as part of their personal development.
Andy acknowledged that not every team successfully delivers a project, but he stressed the importance of reflecting on failures and learning from them.
He encouraged the team to analyze assumptions and identify areas where they might have underestimated tasks or lacked necessary skills.
Andy pointed out that many successful projects have come from teams that turned their setbacks into learning experiences and clearly communicated their progress.

Andy advised the team to conduct a thorough content review, sharing all progress and gathering as much feedback as possible before final presentations.
Andy recommended that each team introduce their project as if the audience has no prior knowledge, providing a concise context and overview.
He reminded the team to prepare a 25-minute presentation, including time for questions, and suggested focusing on major accomplishments and addressing any gaps in the project.


#### Agenda-2: Our team presentation for what they had done for last 2 weeks
Our team discussed progress over the past two weeks, sharing that they have been working on preparing a demo to showcase the main functionalities of the project.
They mentioned some delays but emphasized that they will present a demo showing the core aspects of the AI system, along with placeholders for content that is still under development.
Our team highlighted that while some functionalities are operational, others are still in a preliminary stage and may require further refinement.

Our team explained recent changes in the projectâ€™s direction, particularly regarding the use of SharePoint  and Wordpress as the deployment platform, which necessitated a shift in their original plan.
We discussed how they adapted to new requirements mid-project, resulting in changes to their development approach and tool selection. We shared insights on the importance of aligning with platform constraints and emphasized that they have learned to adapt their strategy based on evolving client requirements.

Andy emphasized the importance of thorough documentation, not only for the current project but also as a good habit for future work. He advised the team to ensure that all decisions, tasks, and risks are well-documented and visible to all stakeholders.
The team was reminded to maintain transparency about any issues or setbacks in the project to provide a clear and honest account of their journey and learnings.

Andy suggested inviting clients to the presentation if possible, as their attendance can provide direct feedback and insights. Our team was advised to prepare for technical reviews by examiners, who may assess both the functionality of the project and the quality of documentation.
