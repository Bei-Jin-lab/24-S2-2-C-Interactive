## **Meeting Minutes**

### **Agenda 1: Final Website Walkthrough & Client Demo**

The team demonstrated the live version of the project website and walked through key functions. Client feedback had already been collected earlier that day. Zara confirmed that the demonstration was satisfactory and encouraged the team to continue maintaining clarity and consistency.

------

### **Agenda 2: Mobile Compatibility and Navigation Issues**

A critical mobile compatibility issue was discussed: the menu bar was not visible on phones. The team clarified that although the desktop version remains unchanged, the mobile version was recently updated to restore functionality. Font inconsistencies (such as non-Public Sans fonts in the footer) were acknowledged and listed for final adjustment. Navigation behaviors (e.g., ANU logo → ANU homepage, title → local homepage) were confirmed as implemented correctly.

------

### **Agenda 3: Chatbot Training & Support Integration**

The chatbot has now been moved to the homepage.Support email provided by the client has been added to chatbot responses. Prompt training procedures were presented to Zara, including how test data is structured. The team clarified that website updates do not automatically re-crawl all links, and this was communicated to the client.

------

### **Agenda 4: Testing Process Clarification**

Zara asked about unit testing status. The team explained that due to the low-code WordPress-based approach, no unit tests were implemented. Instead, the team relied on manual testing and black-box testing, along with weekly debugging based on client feedback. Zara advised the team to log acceptance tests and clarify the rationale (i.e., low-code setup) in documentation.

------

### **Agenda 5: Sprint Summary and Submission Requirements**

Zara reminded the team that Sprint 3 follows the same assessment criteria as Sprint 2. Final group reflection and supporting documents are due June 2. Team was encouraged to reflect critically on project challenges, including testing limitations and improvements made over time.

## **Outcomes**

- Website and chatbot final walkthrough completed and reviewed.
- Mobile and navigation fixes documented for final polish.
