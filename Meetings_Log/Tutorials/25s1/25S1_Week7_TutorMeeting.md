## Meeting Minutes

#### Agenda-1: Review of Last Week’s Progress
Beijin kicked off the meeting by walking us through what was done last week. The team made changes to the website layout, focusing on key functionality updates — like modifying the post section and tweaking the navigation bar titles. On the AI chatbot side, we started training it using the provided training material. A basic version is working, but it still needs more data and further refinement. We also managed to complete the demonstration requested by the client this week.

#### Agenda-2: AI Chatbot and Functionality Planning
The tutor checked in to confirm project details. We clarified that sections like "News," "Seminar," and "Canvas" will link to different pages, and we’re planning to implement those step by step in Sprints 2 and 3. For the chatbot, the client would like a guideline document explaining how to train it — we’ll work on that once they provide more information. Training and data collection are still ongoing.

#### Agenda-3: Assessment Updates
The tutor let us know that a new grading rubric has been introduced. We're expected to review it carefully. Also, there won’t be a tutor session next week, and Sprint Review will be held in Week 9.
