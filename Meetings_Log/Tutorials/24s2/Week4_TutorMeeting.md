## Meeting minutes
Agenda-1: Feedback from our team's Audit 1 and suggestions for improvement
  - Landing Page Review
    - The tutor suggested that the landing page should link directly to the content, allowing client, tutor or shadow  to access documents, code, and logs immediately upon clicking the URL.
    - Improvements are needed in the completeness of the team charter.
    - The tutor emphasized the importance of detailed meeting records, not just conclusions but also the discussion and rationale behind them.

  - Statement of Work
    - The current SOW lacks sufficient detail to enable another project team to continue development without gaps. Need to continue to clarify the details and not just write framework.

  - All logs
    - There is a problem with the formatting of all the logs and they all need to be changed. Be more comprehensive.
    - The tutor noted that all logs (including the Decision Log and Risk Log) require revisions to meet the specified standards.
    - Logs should include who raised the issue, the domain concerned, dates, and any changes in decisions.

Agenda-2: Question session
  - Reflection Questions
    - Questions Asked: Should reflections be written by individuals every week, and what should team reflections cover?
    - Response: Both individual and team reflections are required. Individual reflections should cover what was learned during the week, thoughts on the project, and any inefficiencies encountered. Team reflections should focus on lessons learned, thoughts, and outcomes from achieving small goals within an agile framework.

  - Use of Low-Code Platforms
    - Questions Asked: Will using low-code platforms like WordPress impact our grades?
    - Response: No, using low-code platforms will not affect your grades negatively. You are free to use any tools necessary.

  - Meeting with shadow team
    - Questions Asked: What content should be presented in the meetings with the shadow team?
    - Response: Treat these meetings as if they are client meetings. Each team should present their code and summarize their weekly progress. After presentations, assist each other in identifying issues and understanding the project. Mutual reviews should be conducted at least every two weeks.
  
  - Integration with ANU Domain and ANU ID Authentication
    - Questions Asked: If we are unable to integrate with the ANU domain and use ANU ID authentication, will it impact our grades?
    - Response: It’s fine if full integration isn’t achieved. The tutor emphasized that perfection isn’t required; instead, making the best judgment and effort in the project is what matters.

Agenda 3: Feedback from shadow team's Audit 1 and suggestions for improvement
  - SOW: Very detailed, but no propriety, consider the highest priority, minimum viable product.

Agenda 4: Shadow team Question session
