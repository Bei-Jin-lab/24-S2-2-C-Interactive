## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1:Shadow team introduce the project and suggestions for improvement
(1) Introduction of Document Work

The shadow team began with an introduction to all the document work that has been carried out . Andy was noted that proper documentation and clear organization are crucial for both internal project management and external evaluation by examiners.

(2) Feedback from shadow(our team) and Tutor(Andy)

The shadow team and tutor provided feedback in audit 1, emphasizing the importance of documenting every aspect of the project.

The tutor specifically highlighted the lack of logs for shadow meetings and reminded the team that regular shadow meetings need to be scheduled and logged at least every two weeks.

Andy was recommended that the shadow team meets at least three times in the next five weeks to showcase progress, including landing pages and technical details.

(3) Reflection: Self-Evaluation

The reflection aspect was discussed, with the Andy noting that the current reflections are too brief and lack the necessary depth. The expectation is for more detailed reflections, about 150-200 words per reflection, covering weekly progress, challenges, and planning.

(4) Logs and Documentation 

The audit emphasized that the logs (reflection, risk, decision, etc.) should be organized in a way that non-technical stakeholders can easily understand the project status.

Andy raised concerns about the lack of clarity and organization in the existing documentation, particularly in GitHub. Andy was noted that there are multiple overlapping documents, leading to confusion.

The recommendation was to consolidate information into a single source, ideally a landing page with clear links to key documents like decision logs, risk registers, and reflection logs.
Andy was suggested that each log should contain essential details like the date, person responsible, and key actions or decisions.

Andy stressed the need to make all documents easily accessible and clear for both examiners and non-technical stakeholders. The team was advised to avoid using GitHub as the primary documentation platform for external review due to its complexity and navigation challenges.


#### Agenda-2: Our team introduce the project and suggestions for improvement 
(1) Introduction to the Project and Areas of Improvement

The team introduced the project and outlined areas that need improvement, focusing on better organization and documentation practices.

(2) Reflection Logs
- Andy emphasized that individual reflections are mandatory, each requiring 150-200 words.
- The team needs to backfill reflections for at least weeks 3, 4, and 5.
- Andy recommended adding individual reflection sections either within the weekly document or on a live reflection log accessible to all team members.
- Reflections should capture personal insights, challenges, and realizations, even if they are brief.

(3) Decision Logs

The decision log currently contains only three decisions, which is underpopulated given the amount of discussion in meetings.
Andy stressed the importance of capturing all decisions, no matter how minor they may seem, as even trivial decisions can have significant impacts later.

Andy noted that:
- All decisions made during meetings must be documented in the decision log.
- The decision log should summarize the key points, including the decision maker, date, and details of the decision.
- Any feedback that leads to a change should be reflected in the decision log.

(4) Risk Log

The current risk log is missing key elements, such as the date each risk was identified and a brief description of each risk.

Andy highlighted the need for a comprehensive risk log with clearly defined risks.
Each risk should include a date, detailed description, and status updates if the risk materializes.

The team was advised to categorize risks by likelihood (low, medium, high) and impact, and include a "date occurred" field to track when risks materialize.

(5) Feedback Log

Our team currently lacks a feedback log, which is critical for tracking input from external sources like tutors, shadows, and clients.

Andy explained that feedback from external parties should be logged separately from internal reflections. The log should include the date, source, feedback details, and whether the team agrees or disagrees with the feedback.

Andy noted that:
- A feedback log should be created to capture all feedback from external parties (tutors, shadows, clients).
- The log should include who gave the feedback, the date, details of the feedback, and whether the team agrees with the feedback. If agreed upon, the feedback should be reflected in the decision log.

(6) Landing Page Issues and weekly report

Andy noted that the format of the landing page is disorganized, making it difficult for external viewers to understand the project’s progress.
The landing page should clearly introduce the client and project context, with a standardized format for easier navigation.

Andy emphasized that documentation consistency is crucial. The current formatting of documents on the landing page is inconsistent, with varying font sizes and styles.

Andy emphasized that weekly reports are also a necessary documentation exercise to make it easy for examiners to understand the work assigned to team members, and the number of hours worked in order to understand the contributions of team members.

(7) Milestone Review

Milestones should be revisited and updated if they no longer align with the current project timeline.

Andy advised that milestones should reflect realistic goals based on current progress, with any adjustments clearly documented.


#### Agenda-3: Introducing the next audit request
Andy provided a detailed outline of what should be included in the next audit:
- A clear introduction to the project, including its purpose, client, and objectives.
- A breakdown of the project’s key components (e.g., hardware, software) and how they align with the goals.
- Detailed documentation of must-have, could-have, and nice-to-have features.
- An overview of the team’s roles and responsibilities.
- A comprehensive walk-through of logs (decision, risk, reflection, etc.) and how they interact.
- Andy recommended that the team rehearse the presentation to ensure smooth delivery, aiming for 20 minutes with 5 minutes allocated for questions.
