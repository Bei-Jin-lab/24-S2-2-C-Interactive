## Meeting minutes
Agenda-1: Introduce our group's work for these 2 weeks
- Worked on resolving issues with WordPress security plugin integration, improving the site’s security. 
- Evaluated chatbot solutions and clarified licensing issues with ANU IT, preparing for client discussions with a comparison table.
- Explored WPForms solutions for post submissions without backend access.
- redesigned the SharePoint site, improving visual appeal and exploring platform limitations.




Agenda-2: Receive some suggestions from shadow team 
- Follow up with ANU IT to expedite the approval process.

- Continue communication with ANU IT to resolve licensing issues swiftly.
 

  

Agenda 3: Check the shadow team's work for these 2 weeks
- In Week 7, the team divided responsibilities—three members focused on interface development while four worked on logical components.
- Designed a user interface aimed at young girls, discussing how to make it engaging with animations and sound effects.
- In Week 8, the team implemented the block-based programming logic and optimized control blocks like "if-else" statements.
- enhanced their documentation practices, using GitHub to track progress and improve transparency.
  
- Challenges:Lack of Clear Client Feedback: Further clarification is needed for the design and implementation of certain logic blocks, particularly the sensing and control blocks. Integration Complexity: The team faced technical challenges integrating logical components with the interface, which they addressed through collaboration.
  

Agenda 4: Give some suggestions to shadow team     
- Request Detailed Client Feedback Early: Since there were issues with unclear client feedback, proactively schedule regular meetings with the client specifically to clarify any uncertainties. Prepare a list of specific questions about the logic blocks and the interface design to guide these conversations, ensuring that all critical areas are addressed before moving too far into development.

- Iterative Testing and Prototyping: For both the interface and logic components, introduce regular small-scale testing phases. This can help identify issues early in the process and allow for user-centered adjustments before the final implementation. Even basic usability tests with target users (young girls) could provide valuable insights on engagement and ease of use.
