## Meeting minutes
Agenda-1: Introduce our group's work for these 2 weeks
- Introduce the logs we added to the project, such as tasklog, personalreflective log, feedback log, weekly report.
- Show our modified landingpage
- Introduce the difficulties encountered in the current work (apply for a domain name)
- The front-end and back-end technologies selected (react and database)
 


Agenda-2: Receive some suggestions from shadow team 
- The shadow team reflected their views on the landing page:
 1. The landing page interface has made great progress. However, due to the large number of branches in the log, it is a bit messy. It may be better if it is arranged in a list format.
- The shadow team reflected their views on the log:
 1. The newly added log is very helpful for viewing project progress
- The shadow team reflected their views on the project's difficulties:
 1. Domain name application may involve security, and it is necessary to use a more secure technology to complete the website establishment
 2. React has a high requirement for programming level. Can the team members master this technology as soon as possible to complete the front end

  

Agenda 3: Check the shadow team's work for these 2 weeks
- They introduced some new logs (decisionlog, meetinglog)
- Introduced apps for multi-platform development (Android and iOS)
- Try to come up with a downloadable app demo
  

Agenda 4: Give some suggestions to shadow team     
- The newly added logs are helpful, but some meeting logs lack details
- For the development of iOS platform apps, what technologies need to be involved, and are there any security and privacy issues. These need to be considered as early as possible
- What are the specific requirements for this demo, and when is the deadline?
