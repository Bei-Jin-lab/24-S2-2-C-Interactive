## Meeting minutes
Agenda-1: Organize features based on customer requirements
 - Project Objective:
The project’s goal is to create an interactive website serving as a dynamic education hub for academic staff. The platform will offer a user-friendly interface, allowing even those without technical backgrounds to use it efficiently. Key features include real-time interaction through an AI chatbot and the ability to address common educational queries instantly.

Based on the client's point of view, we brainstormed and listed the following features.
- Features Discussed:
  - Account Login: Includes username, password, CAPTCHA, and "Forgot Password?" options.
  - Third-Party Email Verification: Consider whether it should be included.
  - User Roles:
    - Admin: Assign permissions, view system logs, add/delete users, and reset passwords.
    - Staff+: Includes permissions to delete sections and posts by others but cannot modify others’ posts; can view history.
    - Staff: Can create posts in any section and manage their own posts (add/edit/delete), and view their history.
    - Regular Web Users (No Login Required): Can view any webpage and use the chatbot.
  - User Permission Management: Permissions related to sections.
  - History Tracking: Limited to viewing personal history.
  - Content Management:
    - Cancel, save, publish, preview before publishing.
    - Rich text editor with file format upload options.
  - Custom Columns: Add/modify/delete/sort (consider multi-level directories).
  - Drafts Management.
  - Search/Query: Full-text search by keyword.
  - System Logs: Display only time, operator, target (article/section), and operation (add/delete/edit articles or sections).
  - AI Chatbot: Train using specified file formats.
  - Risk Management: Potential threats include bot attacks and AI plugin usage limitations; traffic estimation and iterative improvement are advised.

Agenda-2: Prioritize the features and break them down into tasks

Based on the above features, we believe that the login and registration functionality, along with the article publishing functionality, are the two features that need to be implemented first.
Therefore, we have broken down these two features into detailed tasks.

See the GitHub task log for details on all tasks.
