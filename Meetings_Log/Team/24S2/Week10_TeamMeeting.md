## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1: Detailed division for presentation
Our team held a discussion on how to organize and assign tasks for the upcoming presentation, focusing on project introduction, code demonstration, and documentation updates. The goal of this meeting was to ensure that each team member understood their role and contribution to the presentation, and that the flow of the presentation would be logical and easy for the audience to follow.

$Project Introduction$
The meeting began with Bingkun outlining the general flow of the presentation. He suggested starting with a high-level introduction of the project. This introduction will include a brief description of the project’s goals, the motivation behind it, and the key features that have been developed so far. It was agreed that this section will be delivered by one team member, who will ensure that the project overview is clear and concise.

The introduction will also touch on the current progress made and explain why the team chose to implement certain technologies while abandoning others. Specifically, the decision to move away from certain technologies, such as those originally planned in earlier stages of the project (e.g., moving away from some frameworks or approaches), will need to be clearly explained. This will set the stage for the rest of the presentation, which will dive into the technical aspects and results.

$Code Demonstration$
After the project introduction, Our team will transition to a demonstration of the code. Bingkun suggested dividing the code into two major sections for ease of presentation. Each group within the team will be responsible for showcasing the code they worked on. Bingkun emphasized the importance of explaining each code block clearly, detailing its functionality and how it contributes to the overall project.

He was noted that visual aids such as screenshots or snippets of the code will be useful for this section, as they will help illustrate the technical achievements more effectively. Each group will not only display the code but will also explain the underlying logic behind it. He pointed out that this explanation should not just focus on the implementation but should also address how each part of the code aligns with the project’s goals.

Additionally, Bingkun suggested that each code presentation should be linked to a specific problem solved by that code. This will help the audience understand why certain design decisions were made. For example, he mentioned that the audience might be curious about why some functions were implemented in one way and not another, and these questions should be addressed proactively during the presentation.

$Documentation and Updates$
Our team also discussed the documentation updates, with Bingkun highlighting the importance of having one person dedicated to this task. This person will be responsible for presenting the updates made to the project documentation, ensuring that it is clear what changes were made and why.

The documentation section will cover both functional and technical updates. For example, there may be adjustments to the architecture of the project, or changes in how certain features were documented. The team acknowledged that some of the issues discussed in previous meetings, such as limitations with WordPress and other tools, will need to be mentioned in this section.

$Explanation of SOW$
An important part of the presentation will be explaining why certain features were either dropped or modified. Bingkun mentioned that this section will require careful attention, as the client may ask why specific decisions were made. For instance, he noted that one of the features was initially planned but later abandoned due to technical constraints. This rationale should be clearly articulated in the presentation, along with any alternatives that were considered.

Additionally, Our team agreed that the rationale for choosing certain technologies over others must be well-documented and explained during the presentation. Bingkun suggested including a specific section that addresses the decision to abandon certain solutions, such as why React was dropped, and how that decision impacted the project’s direction. The presentation will include a section that outlines what has been completed so far and what remains to be done. It was emphasized by Jinghan that this section should provide an honest account of the project's status, including any setbacks or challenges encountered along the way.

$Future work$
Furthermore, Our team discussed the importance of addressing the Future Work section. This part of the presentation will outline the next steps for the project, focusing on a high-level overview rather than technical details. Our team agreed that the audience would be more interested in understanding the project’s broader roadmap rather than specific technical features.

Bingkun pointed out that the team should keep this section concise but comprehensive, covering major milestones such as upcoming feature implementations and planned improvements. It was agreed that this section will be placed at the end of the presentation, giving the audience a clear understanding of where the project is headed in the future.
#### Agenda-2: Determine the completion date and rehearsal date
Our team discussed the timing and structure of the upcoming presentation, with a focus on allocating time for each team member and scheduling a rehearsal.

Bingkun began by explaining that since there are seven members in the group, each person will be allocated approximately 3 minutes and 10 seconds to speak during the presentation. This time allocation is designed to ensure that the entire presentation fits within the given time limit, which is expected to be around 20 minutes for speaking, plus an additional 5 minutes for Q&A.

Bingkun suggested that Wednesday evening would be a good time for the first rehearsal, but other options, such as Thursday, were also considered. Yujing added that some sections of the presentation might take slightly longer, while others could be shorter, depending on the content. Therefore, the team should be flexible with timing during the rehearsal to see how everything flows together.

Our team discussed whether it was necessary for every team member to present during the final presentation. Jinsong asked if everyone was required to speak, to which Bingkun confirmed that all team members must participate. The reason is to demonstrate the contribution of each member, and the client would likely expect to hear from everyone involved.

It was also mentioned that the project introduction should include a brief explanation of each team member’s role in the project, helping the audience understand who worked on which parts of the project. Jinghan suggested that the introduction should be detailed enough to give even someone unfamiliar with the project a good understanding of what the team has accomplished.

Our team agreed that the first rehearsal should be held on Thursday morning. Bingkun stressed the importance of practicing the timing of each section to ensure that the presentation runs smoothly and fits within the allocated 20 minutes.

Bingkun mentioned that the entire presentation, including Q&A, should not exceed 25 minutes. This will give the audience enough time to ask questions, but it also means the team needs to stay on schedule during their rehearsal.

Bingkun asked each team member to prepare at least 1-2 slides for their section of the presentation, but no more than 5 slides. The goal is to keep the presentation visually clear and concise, while still providing enough detail to explain each part of the project. 

The meeting concluded with a discussion on final preparations. Bingkun reminded the team to make sure the presentation flows smoothly, and that everyone knows their part. A shared document or presentation file will be created to allow everyone to work on their sections collaboratively. Additionally, Yujing was tasked with preparing the Q&A slide and a concluding "Thank You" slide for the end of the presentation.

Bingkun also mentioned that both the opening and closing slides need to be prepared in advance, and the team should be ready to field any questions from the audience during the Q&A session.
