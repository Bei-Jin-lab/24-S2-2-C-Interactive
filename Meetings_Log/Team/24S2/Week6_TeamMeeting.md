Our team set a deadline for the presentation slides to be completed by Thursday at 12:00 PM.

#### Agenda-2: UML  
The primary focus of the meeting was the UML diagram, which is critical for the current project phase. Yiou Liu suggested a quick discussion on the UML components (classes, attributes, methods) could help speed up the process later.

Yujing Zhang volunteered to draft an initial version of the UML diagram. The group also briefly discussed the interaction flow between the frontend and backend, with a suggestion to reference materials from a web design course to guide the design.

The group briefly discussed the initial steps for code implementation but decided to focus on the diagram and presentation first.
