## Meeting minutes
#### Agenda-1: Check Ed and TechLauncher on Audit 2  
Base on Ed, We find:
- From 9am Monday 26th your project landing pages and repositories may be audited.
- Please invite your client to attend your audit tutorial, either on Zoom or physically.
- Our team should attend tutorials with a proposed agenda, circulated prior to the meeting.
- In your shadow role you should have reviewed the records of the team you are shadowing for 3 hours outside of regular meetings.
- Before midnight Friday 30th of August every team member must have
    - [1] Submitted one Week06 "Evaluation of your own team" record
    - [2] Submitted one Week06 "Evaluation of the team you are shadowing" record
    - [3] Submitted one Week03 "Team member contribution" record
- By midnight Friday September 6 every team member must have:
    - [4] Submitted one Week03 "Evaluation of Feedback Quality" record

Base on TechLauncher, We find:

The aim of the Project Audits is to demonstrate that your team has been working effectively and delivering real value to your clients, to each other, and to shadows. Reviewers will be looking for evidence and quality of:
- effective and appropriate decision making
- meaningful and useful project governance: decision log, risk register, and reflection log
- signed record of formal acceptance criteria with client
- roles and activities related to the delivery/acceptance process
- quantitative record of progress towards acceptance/delivery
- value delivered to the client
- appropriate lean and fit for purpose documentation
- technical artefacts including, as applicable, models, source code, test data and prototypes

Input to this process will be Tag Reports that address the following criteria:

Outputs [limited  $ \Leftrightarrow $ outstanding]
$\hspace{2em}$ How valuable are the team’s outputs to key stakeholders, given the level of effort and other resources 
$\hspace{2em}$ available to the team?
Decision Making [chaotic $ \Leftrightarrow $ structured and efficient]
$\hspace{2em}$    How are the team’s processes for making, implementing, evaluating and learning from decisions?
Teamwork [uncoordinated $ \Leftrightarrow $ highly skilled coordination]
$\hspace{2em}$   How is the team working together to achieve project outcomes?
Stakeholder Engagement [absent $ \Leftrightarrow $ productive and exceptionally coherent]
$\hspace{2em}$   How is the team communicating with, and managing the expectations of key stakeholders?
Reflection [superficial $ \Leftrightarrow $ insightful and driving positive change]
$\hspace{2em}$   How is the team reviewing feedback and acting on it to improve their performance?

#### Agenda-2: Clarify the work that needs to be improved  
Based on the requirements and the tutor's improvement suggestions, our team has identified several issues currently present in our project:
- Task Log: 
The task log only includes tasks related to project development, neglecting other important activities such as documentation, communication, and management tasks. We need to expand our task log to include all work-related responsibilities, not just development tasks.

- Meeting Log: 
The meeting log has not been updated regularly. While we have recorded meeting minutes, we have failed to synchronize those updates into the log itself. Moving forward, we must ensure that every meeting is properly logged with both the minutes and corresponding updates in the meeting log.

- Feedback Log: 
We currently lack a feedback log, which the tutor emphasized is essential. This log is necessary to track feedback from various stakeholders, including the client, shadow teams, tutors, and the convenor. The tutor suggested that the feedback log should not require lengthy entries. Instead, it should include a brief summary of the feedback, a decision on whether to accept it, and if accepted, the feedback should be added to the decision log.

- Decision Log: 
At present, our decision log only contains three decisions, all related to code development. However, we have made many other decisions that have not been logged. We need to revisit our meetings and ensure that all significant decisions, including those unrelated to development, are recorded in the log.

- Reflection Log and Individual reflection: 
Our group reflections are incomplete, lacking individual contributions. The tutor highlighted the importance of individual reflections, so we created a folder dedicated to this purpose. Each team member is expected to add their weekly reflections, answering questions such as: What have I done? What challenges did I face, and how did I solve them? What did I learn or improve?

- Risk Log: 
We have not fully recognized common project risks, such as personnel turnover. It is crucial that we consider and document a comprehensive range of risks, ensuring that our risk log is thorough and up-to-date.

- Weekly Report:
We have been neglecting to produce weekly reports. The tutor pointed out that these reports are essential as they provide a summary of what each team member has accomplished during the week and the amount of time spent. This practice will help us track progress more effectively.

- Landing Page: 
The tutor commented that our landing page is very disorganized, making it difficult for others to understand. Additionally, there is a lack of consistency in font sizes and styles, and the page does not include a clear introduction to the client. We need to reorganize the landing page, ensure consistency in formatting, and include relevant client information.

- New Version of SOW: 
Based on the feedback we have received over the past few weeks, we revised our milestone plans in the statement of work (SOW). Consequently, we need to produce and upload a new version of the SOW to reflect these changes.

- Shadow Team Meeting: 
According to requirements on Ed, we need to hold regular meetings with our shadow team and ensure that meeting records are properly documented.
