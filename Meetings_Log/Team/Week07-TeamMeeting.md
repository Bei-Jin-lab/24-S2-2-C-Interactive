## Meeting Minutes

### Agenda 1: Review of Feedback on Website and Chatbot
The team reviewed the initial feedback received on the website, focusing on the seminar section and the chatbot functionality.

- **Seminar Section:** Feedback indicated a need for actual content to demonstrate its functionality. The team discussed uploading an example seminar recording. There was a suggestion to create dedicated pages for News, Canvas, and Seminars to allow for easier content uploading.
- **Chatbot:** Initial feedback was positive. Discussions revolved around the chatbot's ability to provide links to resources and the accuracy of its responses, particularly concerning importing content from Moodle to Canvas. The team acknowledged that the current answer for Moodle to Canvas migration might not be ideal and discussed the possibility of feeding specific instructions into the chatbot for desired responses.

### Agenda 2: UI Improvements based on Feedback
Based on the feedback, the team discussed the following UI improvements:

- **Seminar Page:** The team agreed to create a dedicated page for seminars where recordings can be uploaded.
- **News and Canvas Pages:** Separate pages for News (education-related) and Canvas information will also be created.
- **Chatbot Feedback Mechanism:** The existing feedback mechanism was noted.
- **Clarity on Chatbot Channels:** Speaker 2 mentioned not seeing a specific feedback channel initially.

### Agenda 3: Discussion on Q&A and Document Integration in Chatbot
The team discussed the logic behind the chatbot's responses, differentiating between the Q&A section and the uploaded documents.

- **Keyword Recognition:** The chatbot prioritizes exact keyword matches in the Q&A section. If a sentence contains the keyword, it will search the uploaded documents.
- **Priority Setting:** There was a discussion on setting priority for different sources (Q&A vs. Documents) during training. Speaker 1 confirmed that constraints can be used to prioritize either Q&A or document training.
- **Q&A Input Method:** Q&A entries need to be added one by one, while documents can be uploaded for training. Uploading a Q&A file directly to the Q&A section is not supported.
