## Meeting minutes

### Agenda-1: Introduce WordPress updates
Jinsong provided a detailed update on the current progress of the WordPress project, covering the homepage, publishing features, and AI chatbot functionality.

Jinsong introduced the homepage structure, explaining that the homepage consists of several modules. And he was noted that the search function needs optimization, as it currently retrieves articles that contain any occurrence of a particular letter, making it less effective for more specific queries.

Henry agreed that, overall, the current implementation looks acceptable but mentioned that the detailed features still need further refinement.

Jinsong then stated that the current version would be used as the foundation for the upcoming audit.

### Agenda-2: Introduce AI chatbot
Our team discussed the current limitations of the AI chatbot. The main issues raised include the fact that the chatbot is currently running on a free version, which limits training to one link and the chatbot can only respond to up to 10 questions from that link.

Jinghan was suggested that if clients decide to upgrade to a paid plan, our team should be restrictions placed on the chatbot. Since this chatbot is intended for CBE education, it is an English website, it should not be allowed to answer all types of questions(only answer about canvas), especially as it is connected to GPT-4. The idea is to limit the chatbot to answering questions related to CBE policies or the new Canvas platform, and to restrict it to English queries only. Another issue raised was that currently, there is no login or registration required, meaning anyone can access and ask questions freely.

Henry asked about the advantages of upgrading to a paid plan. Jinghan responded, explaining that with a $19$ USD per month plan, the chatbot’s training would be unlimited, and the service would provide 2,000 credits for usage. The $99$ USD per month plan would offer 10,000 credits and additional features such as the ability to have multiple users or back-end operators.

There was also a discussion about whether non-relevant queries would count against the credit usage, which is currently unclear because the free version has not been thoroughly tested. Henry raised concerns about potential abuse of the chatbot, suggesting that without proper login functionality, people could exploit the system and drain the credits by asking irrelevant questions.

Our team considered introducing some form of user verification, such as login restrictions, to ensure that only authorized users (e.g., CBE staff or students) could access the chatbot. Different options were discussed, including creating a shared account for all users or implementing simple front-end password protection to limit access to the chatbot page.

Our team concluded that further testing and exploration of login restrictions, either through plugins or simple code-based solutions, would be necessary to prevent potential abuse of the system.

### Agenda-3: Introduce Sharepoint updates
Bingkun began by explaining that SharePoint does not have the same issue as WordPress regarding access, as SharePoint requires users to log in before accessing the content. Bingkun provided an overview of the SharePoint interface, showing how templates can be selected for publishing content. However, there is a noted issue with deleting content, which requires navigating to specific sections, making it less convenient.

Our team discussed how to add new items to the menu and how SharePoint handles modular content. Yujing explained that content is displayed on the homepage in blocks, which act as both the menu and content access points. New content can be linked within these blocks, allowing users to navigate from the homepage.

There was also a comparison of the search functions between SharePoint and WordPress, with WordPress being considered more user-friendly in terms of immediate results and dropdown options.

The discussion then moved on to plans for adding content during the team’s break. Henry suggested starting to add content immediately, while Jinsong mentioned some bugs in the interface that might make posting difficult. However, Jinsong also noted that these issues could be bypassed by using administrative accounts to post content directly.

Our team also discussed the chatbot pricing and how many credits would be needed for usage. Jinghan mentioned that the platform allows multiple users and accounts to collaborate, and higher subscription levels would support faster responses from the system.

In conclusion, Our team agreed to start with a basic content addition plan during the break and explore further updates and optimizations next semester.
