## Meeting Minutes

### Agenda 1: Presentation of Two Website Categorization Methods

* The team presented two approaches to creating categorized pages for the website.
* **Method 1** utilized WordPressâ€™s built-in directory structure. While simple, it does not support sub-categories or customized title formatting.
* **Method 2** involved creating new WordPress blocks for each category page (e.g., News, Canvas, Seminars). This method allows for high flexibility and complete customization of layout and design.
* After comparison, the client preferred **Method 2** for better control and presentation quality.

### Agenda 2: AI Chatbot Demonstration and Data Update Process

* The current version of the AI chatbot was demonstrated, showing:

   * Improved precision and accuracy in response generation
   * Reference links automatically added at the end of each answer, directing users to relevant original training pages
* The team introduced the **one-click update** method for training data, simplifying future maintenance.
* It was suggested that after significant content updates to the website, chatbot data should be retrained weekly to stay aligned.
* The team delivered a **Guidebook** to the client, detailing how to update and retrain the chatbot independently.

### Agenda 3: Discussion on Email Footer and Future Updates

* The client requested that each chatbot answer ends with a **technical support email address**.
* The team asked the client to provide a specific support email so this feature can be implemented in the next version.
