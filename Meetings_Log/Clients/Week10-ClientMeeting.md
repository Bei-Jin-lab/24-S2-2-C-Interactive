## Meeting Minutes

### Agenda 1: Website Accessibility and User Experience Feedback

* The client provided feedback on **mobile accessibility**:

    * The current website **menu bar is not visible on mobile devices**, indicating a lack of mobile adaptation.
    * The client requested to **keep the desktop version unchanged** for now.
* The client suggested adding **a brief introduction** on the homepage to explain:

    * What this website is for
    * Why this website exists
    * How to use the website
* **Footer font issue**: The client noticed that the **footer titles are not using "Public Sans"** as intended.
* **Navigation improvement**:

    * Clicking the **ANU logo** should lead to the **ANU main page**.
    * Clicking the **website title** should return users to the **website’s homepage**.

### Agenda 2: AI Chatbot Placement, Custom Q\&A, and Email Footer Update

* The client **placed the chatbot on the homepage**.
* The client requested adding **specific Q\&A content**, such as **“How to use this website”**, to the chatbot to improve user guidance.
* The **technical support email** was provided by the client and will be added to the **footer of chatbot responses**.
* The **Prompt Guide**, including test examples, was shared and demonstrated.
* The team explained the **training process**, clarifying that:

    * Content updates on the website **will be reflected in the chatbot**.
    * However, **existing links will not be re-crawled** unless manually specified.

### Agenda 3: Review of Delivery Plan and Data Security Considerations

* The **delivery plan** was presented to the client.
* The client reminded the team that **sensitive information (e.g., usernames, passwords)** should **not be stored in public repositories** on GitHub, to prevent exposure to students.

    * Sensitive information should be communicated **via Teams** instead.
* Delivery scope and schedule were confirmed with the client.
