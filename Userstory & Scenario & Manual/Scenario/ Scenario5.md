Professor Zhu, a long-time faculty member at the College of Business and Economics (CBE), has noticed that many students and fellow professors struggle to find relevant academic resources and information efficiently on the existing department website. With the recent migration from Wattle to Canvas for course management, this problem has become more pronounced, especially for new students and faculty members unfamiliar with either system.

After receiving numerous questions from confused students about where to find course materials, seminar schedules, and academic news, Professor Zhu decided to take action. He proposed developing an independent CBE Education Website that would serve as a central hub for all essential academic information. The overall objective was to create a user-friendly platform where users could quickly locate the information they need without navigating through complex menu structures or searching across multiple disconnected systems.

The project involved several key steps: collecting and organizing existing information scattered across various platforms, designing a clean and intuitive website interface, publishing comprehensive guides and resources on the CBE website, and ensuring that all content was logically categorized and easy to find. Professor Zhu worked with a small team of teaching assistants to gather course-specific materials, seminar schedules, and frequently asked questions.

One of the main problems they needed to address was that users often struggled to find relevant information in the unfamiliar interface of the existing systems. Many students would miss important announcements simply because they didn't know where to look, and new professors had difficulty uploading course materials correctly.
To solve these issues, Professor Zhu implemented two key solutions. First, they completely redesigned the website interface to make it simpler and more intuitive, with clear navigation categories and a powerful search function. Second, they created a robust categorization system that automatically published content in relevant sections like "News," "Canvas," and "Seminar," ensuring that information would appear in all appropriate places without requiring manual cross-posting. This dual approach significantly improved information accessibility and reduced the learning curve for new users of the CBE academic systems.
