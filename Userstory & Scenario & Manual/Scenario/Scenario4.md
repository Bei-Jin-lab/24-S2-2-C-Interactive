### Scenario: Seamless Chatbot Access While Browsing the CBE Website

**Professor Wang** often finds it inconvenient to switch between multiple tabs when using ChatGPT alongside reading materials.  
He wishes that instead of constantly toggling between windows, he could interact with the chatbot directly within the same page.

To improve his experience on the **CBE website**, he hopes for a more seamless solution —  
specifically, the ability to open a **chatbot window embedded in the current webpage**,  
allowing him to ask questions and receive support without leaving the content he’s viewing.
