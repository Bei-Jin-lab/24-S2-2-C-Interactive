Our transition to Canvas will happen in stages over the next two years (2024-2026). Our first showcase and training for ANU Information Technology Services administration staff kicked off in August 2024.?‘First look’ webinars will take place in September 2024. We are working closely with Associate Deans (Education), as well as local education design and support teams, who continue to provide valuable feedback on the transition from WATTLE to Canvas.

Behind the scenes, integration of key tools such as Turnitin, Echo360, and Leganto has commenced to ensure we have a connected learning ecosystem when we go live in Semester 2, 2025. """

In this video we are looking at how to create Padlet activities and how to embed them in Canvas. Padlet is an online collaborative board for capturing, organising and sharing ideas and materials in a visually appealing format.  You can use Padlet in your Canvas courses to encourage synchronous or asynchronous interaction in whole class discussions and in Group work. Let's start from the 'ANU Digital Tools and Learning and Teaching' page. Scroll down and select 'Padlet'.You can find more information on 'logging in' on this page. The link to this page is in the description below the video.  When you're ready, click 'Login to Padlet'.  Once logged in, you'll land on the home page. Select 'Gallery' in the top menu.  Here you'll see a number of Padlet templates.  You can select 'Education 'in the top right menu to find more relevant templates.  Use the filter on the left to narrow down your search for a template you need. Here are some templates for assignments and more activity templates. Let's pick 'About us'. This is the Padlet we've created. It's empty for now. Click here to see an example. In the 'Settings panel' you can change the title, provide a description and select a new icon. You can change the appearance by changing the wallpaper font, colour and size and also size of the posts. Consider a relevant theme that aligns with the topic of the activity you're creating. For the layout you can select the format and how the posts are sorted. It is by Drag and drop', 'date' or 'subject' for engagement depending on the intention of the paddle activity. You can turn comments and reactions 'on' or 'off'. You have the option of hiding author and timestamp. You can also customise post subjects body and attachment. You can edit and add more custom fields. Lastly, would you like to enable moderation? Do posts and comments need to be approved? When you are happy with the settings, you can select 'Generate Sample Posts' to generate some sample posts. You can easily delete these sample posts by clicking 'Delete'. Next, select 'Open Share Panel'. Two things here you need to take note of are 'Visitors permissions 'and 'Link privacy'. To allow your students to write posts, choose 'Writer'. Other options available include allowing your visitors to read or comment on the posts. Only select whichever is applicable. To ensure students can view and interact with your Padlet, ensure to choose 'Secret'. This means your Padlet will be available for anyone with the link. Select 'Embed in your blog or website'. Select 'Copy Board Embed Code'. In your canvas course, you can create a new page or choose the page, assignment or discussion where you want to embed this Padlet. In this video, we will select a page. Click 'Edit'. In the Rich Content Editor field, place your cursor in the position you want to embed the Padlet. Select the 'Embed' icon in the toolbar. If the embed icon is not visible, click on the three dots to display all. You'll now be able to see the 'Embed' icon. Alternatively, you can select 'Insert' in the top navigation menu and select 'Embed' in the menu. Then paste the Padlet board code in the field provided. Click 'Submit'. When you are done embedding the Padlet, remember to save the page. The Padlet is now embedded on the page. Here are other videos that you may find useful. You can access other Canvas support resources via the ANU Digital Plan Hub."
